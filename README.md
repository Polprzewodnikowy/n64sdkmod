# N64 SDK for Linux

Welcome! This SDK is designed to be easy to install and use for newcomers to the N64, and is supported on Debian-based Linux distros,
such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

It also works fine on WSL1, but does not support rsp-tools due to lack of 32bit support.

For documentation, visit the Modern SDK page [on my website](https://crashoveride95.github.io/n64hbrew/modernsdk/index.html).
