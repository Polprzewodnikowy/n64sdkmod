<b> When I burn a 256M ROM with the Flash Gang Writer, it doesn't execute.  It works with a 128MROM, but I can't figure out why this is so.

<P><A name="03"><FONT color="#FF0000"><STRONG>Q3</STRONG></FONT></A> <STRONG>When developing a program for an Asian market (for example), is it a problem if all the messages for the game player are displayed in English?  If there are detailed regulations, please tell me where they are explained. 
</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color="#008000"><STRONG>A3</STRONG></FONT> There are no clear regulations on messages; however, basically, we would like you to display an important message such as the one that prompts a caution to users in Japanese. (Examples: Please insert Controller Pak. The contents of Controller Pak is destroyed. etc.)</P>
<P>As for other messages, though we should localize everything into Japanese if the prospective users for the game includes a young age group, it may not be a problem when English is used to some extent if users are in older age group. To be specific,  such words as "SELECT MENU" or "EXIT" can remain in English for older users, but operation methods and cautions should not be in English.  
</P>
<P>Also, those items with different names in various markets (for example, Rumble Pak) need to be translated so as to use the proper name for that market. Otherwise it wouldn't make any sense to the user. </P>
