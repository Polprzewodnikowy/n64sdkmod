<P>
<FONT   color="#008000"><b>A2</b></FONT>    This can be resolved by installing patch 1118 included in OS2.01_N64_PAK (SGI version). 

<P>
However, this is true only for users using the MIPS compiler for IRIX 5.3 and early IRIX 6.2.  If you will be purchasing the compiler in the future, this doesn't need to be installed since the patch is included in the IRIX 6.2 and IRIX 6.3 MIPS compilers.

<b> When I insert the N64 emulator board connected to the INDY, it isn't recognized.</b>

<P>
<FONT   color="#008000"><b>A5</b></FONT>    Consider the following causes and countermeasures.

<P>
<b>1  Library is not installed.</b>

<P>
--> Install the library according to the <a href="../../pro-man/index.htm" target="index">N64 Programming Manual</a> or Chapter 5 of the <a href="../../kantan/step2/index.htm" target="index">N64 Introductory Manual, Step 2</a>.

<P>
<b>2  The board overheated making recognition impossible</b>

<P>
--> INDY boards are often susceptible to heat, so be sure to close the lid on the INDY when it is in use.  Closing the lid will lower the temperature of the chips inside the board to approximately 20 degrees.  In addition, recognition sometimes just misses, in which case, do not reboot, but turn the power OFF/ON a couple of times.  If the board recognition configuration is not started on a reboot, it could be that the board has been damaged.  If none of these measures works, you may try replacing the board.  If this still doesn't work, we will replace the emulator board free of charge.  In this case, describe the symptoms as clearly as possible and send the board to our Support Center.  If you are able somehow to use the board, but would like to get it repaired anyway, consult with us and we will lend you a board. Once the board arrives, we will replace the defective product.

<b>I want to create a tool for previewing graphics data on the N64 development system, but in order to do that, it is necessary to load the data file output by the modeling tool to the N64 development system.  Is there a method for directly loading programs which operate on the N64 without compiling a file on the SGI disk or data in memory? </b>

<P>
<FONT   color="#008000"><b>A6</b></FONT>    There are functions, such as the <a href="../../n64man/uh/uhWriteRamrom.htm">uhWriteRamrom()</a> function, etc., which act between the Indy and the ramrom on the board.  See the description for uhWriteRamrom() for further details.

<FONT   color="#008000"><b>A8</b></FONT>    "1.2.4 Software Installation Method for N64 Development" is explained for the IRIX5.3 in the Programming Manual, but if you are using O2, install the following programs.

<b> Can applications be developed using the SRAM on the Indy+NUS Emulator Board?</b>

<P>
<FONT  color="#008000"><b>A9</b></FONT> No they can't.

<P>
It is also impossible to develop 64DD or 128Mbit or larger applications with the emulator board configuration.  Of course, it is possible to burn the resulting ROM image into a Flash Cartridge and then check its operation.

<b> I am developing on an SGI. Is there a way to find the actual program size?</b>

<P>
<FONT   color="#008000"><b>A11</b></FONT>   When the -d option is specified with 
<A href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</A>, an intermediate file is left in /tmp.  Try referring to this file.  The address for each segment is defined in /tmp/segment*.s.

<P><B>An error occurs in <a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a> with the current N64OS.</B>
<P><FONT color="#008000"><b>A12</b></FONT> We did testing of operations with IRIX6.5 before.  Efforts towards compatibility were discontinued because we could not use the function to avoid the continuous multiplication bug when -o32 option was added.
<P>You might want to use exeGCC for program development with IRIX6.5.
<P>Not all of them, but some operations such as graphics preview, which don't require compiling were tested.  
<P>Also, the driver of emulator board for IRIX6.5 tentatively exists.

<P><A name="13"><FONT color="#FF0000"><b>Q13</b></FONT></A> <B>I tried to determine a secure stack size using <a href="../../n64man/tool/stacktool.htm">stacktool</a>, it did not work properly. Can I not use this?</B>
<P><FONT color="#008000"><b>A13</b></FONT> 
This does not work properly sometimes on such occasians as when a complex overlay process is going on.  And, if there are recursive calls or calls with a function pointer, sometimes it is difficult to find a correct value.
<P>Though it may not be a correct value, you can obtain the rough size of the stack by running the program after filling out the stack area with patterns, and checking how much the stack is being used really.
<P>Since the source of <a href="../../n64man/tool/stacktool.htm">stacktool</a> has not been upgraded since 1995, it is unknown how precise it is when used for the current N64 OS.  Regard the value that is output as just a reference even in case of an object <a href="../../n64man/tool/stacktool.htm">stacktool</a> runs.
