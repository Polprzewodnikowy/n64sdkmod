<B><A name="qa1"></A><FONT  color="#ff0000">Q1</FONT> Will you continue to support conversions such as <A href="../../n64man/tool/mksprite.htm">mksprite</A> that you have distributed in the past?  Could we at least keep the source codes for them? </B>

<P>
<B><FONT color="#008000">A1</FONT></B> <A href="../../n64man/tool/mksprite.htm">mksprite</A>, <A href="../../n64man/tool/mksprite32.htm">mkasprite32</A>, and <A href="../../n64man/tool/mkisprite.htm">mkisprite</A> are standard tools for producing CI and RGBA texture images.  Consequently, we will continue to support them.

<B><A name="qa2"></A><FONT   color="#ff0000">Q2</FONT> Images of data that I produced with rgb2c get vertically inverted.  Why is that? </B>

<P>
<B><FONT color="#008000">A2</FONT></B> If they are in the ~.rgb SGI format, they probably will not be inverted.  Please recheck and make sure they are in rgb format.  Details are written in the appendix of the RGB2C function manual.

<P>
<B><A name="qa3"></A><FONT   color="#ff0000">Q3</FONT> Is the texture conversion command "rgb2c" used in SGI available for PC?</B>

<P>
<B><FONT color="#008000">A3</FONT></B> Since the rgb format is for use with SGI systems, there is no rgb2c available for the PC.  Instead, the bmp2u64.exe file has been uploaded to NTSC-ONLINE.  In addition, The N64 CITextureEditor can output the N64 C structure of color index textures.

<B><A name="qa4"></A><FONT  color="#ff0000">Q4</FONT> It appears that I have mksprite, etc., but where are they actually stored? </B>

<P>
<B><FONT  color="#008000">A4</FONT></B> I think those tools are only included with Indy.  They are not included with the PC version.  This is because, in the case of mksprite, for example, an input image file is handled only by an SGI machine in the .rgb format.  Other tools are similar and are only for Indy.

<B><A name="qa5"><FONT color="#ff0000">Q5</FONT> </A> I would like to create NINTENDO64 graphics data, but what kind of development tools are there, and how would I go about doing this? </B>

<P>
<B><FONT color="#008000">A5</FONT></B> Nintendo has the "Nintendo Intermediate File Format" available as an intermediate graphics format for the N64.  Since it is recommended that CG tools which are compatible with this be used, anyone wishing to start doing graphics development for the NINTENDO64 and to select development tools should first take a look at the <A href="../../niff/niff_navi2/index.htm">NIFF Navigator</A>.

<P>
<B><A name="qa6"><FONT   color="#ff0000">Q6</FONT></A> When I do a NIFF conversion on data in Lightwave3D, the error message "post_obj_nodes bad poligon" appears.  What does this mean?  I tried changing all of the parts to triangles, but it didn't resolve anything. </B>

<P>
<B><FONT  color="#008000">A6</FONT></B> This error will come up when you attempt to convert a polygon "without 3 vertexes."  For instance, a strange polygon will be created if you select a point which is a modeler and then DELETE it.  If this is then NIFF-converted in Layout, this error will occur.  Press the "w" key in the modeler to bring up the "polygon statistics" window, where you can confirm that there is a polygon that does not have 3 vertexes.

<B><A name="qa7"><FONT color="#ff0000">Q7</FONT></A> How do I edit vertex colors in [LightWave3D]N64?</B>

<P>
<B><FONT  color="#008000">A7</FONT></B> Use "Vertex Paint" sold by D. Storm.

<P>
<B><A name="qa8"><FONT   color="#ff0000">Q8</FONT></A> When I edit a Softimage texture which has been UV-coordinated after executing Show UV in Mattr->Paint, it is very easy to use, but when I UV-convert a texture with a repeat, it doesn't look like it did before in Paint, and it is extremely difficult to edit.</B>

<P>
<B>I've thought of trying various things, such as rewriting the texture without the repeat, registering the material divided into small pieces, or carefully combining textures as a projection rather than using UV, but what is a concrete way of avoiding this? </B>

<P>
<B><FONT   color="#008000">A8</FONT></B> Repeat is reflected in the normal shade view, but it will not be reflected in the Paint shade view, but in any case, this is probably difficult due to the implementation of 3D Paint, or something similar. 


<P>
There are a lot of restrictions, but try the following technique.  This method can be used even if Repeat is used within one polygon. 


<P>
<ol>
<li>After the environment variable setenv SI_SHADE_TEXTURE_REPEAT 1 has been set, start
     Softimage.
<P>
<li>Apply the texture and UV-convert it in Paint.
<P>
<li>Try setting more than one value for the UV of one of the polygon's vertexes.  This will
     allow you to confirm if the texture will be automatically repeated within the polygon. 
     However, some kind of processing with a converter, or the like may be necessary for this
     portion after the game has been used.  
</ol>
<P>
Furthermore, if the function of copying the UV value in polygon units is used, the UV of the same texture will be referred to from multiple polygons, creating the same condition as if Repeat were used.  ("Polygon" Copy, Paste buttons in Paint.)
