<h2>1. What is S2DEX Microcode?</h2>

<p>S2DEX microcode was developed in order to enable the sprites and BG functions which were realized by the hardware in Super NES to be used on the Nintendo 64 (hereinafter, N64).  This makes it easier to create sprite games than in the past.  In addition, by handling the rendering objects as the two separate concepts of sprites and BG Screens, it makes it easier to get used to programming for the N64.
