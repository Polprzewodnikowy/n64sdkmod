=============================== (naudio.dev)<br>
</p>

<p>Modifications:<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
The n_audio library, which was released as a patch for 2.0H, has been included in Version 2.0I for RCP 2.0. 
<br>
The directory structure under /usr/src/PR was revised.
<br>Demo software is now installed in /usr/src/PR/demos. Please see /usr/src/PR/README.txt additional information.<br>
See also, /usr/src/PR/demos/README_DEMOS_NAUDIO.txt for explanations of the demo software. 
<br>
<br>
The following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio.h.<br>
<br>
1. extern declarations of n_audio microcodes were contained. Specifically, the following 2 lines were added.<br>
<br>
extern long long int n_aspMainTextStart[], n_aspMainTextEnd[];<br>
extern long long int n_aspMainDataStart[], n_aspMainDataEnd[];<br>
<br>
2. A declaration of function, n_alSynFreeFX() was added. However, please note that this function is not implemented in the same manner as in the SGI audio library. <br>
<br>
3. A declaration of function, n_alSynSetFXtype(), was deleted. This is because the SGI audio library function, alSynSetFXtype(), which is compatible with this function does not exist. Also, the function itself is incomplete.<br>
<br>
The following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio_s_to_n.h. <br>
<br>
1. A macro to convert the SGI audio library function, alSynFreeFX() to the n_audio library function, n_alSynFreeFX() was added. <br>
<br>
2. A macro to convert the SGI audio library function, alSynSetFXtype() to n_audio library function, n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted. <br>
</p>

<p>Currently, the documents are reorganized to include additional information.<br>
