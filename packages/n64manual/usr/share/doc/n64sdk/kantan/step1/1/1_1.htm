The game software is supplied by an N64 Game Pak and/or an N64 Disk Drive Disk through the parallel interface.
<p>The N64 Disk Drive is connected to the N64 Control Deck via the expansion slot located on the bottom of the Control Deck.
<P>Up to 4 Controllers can be connected to the N64 Control Deck at any one time through the serial interface.
<p>You can add a Controller Pak or a Rumble Pak to each Controller. The Controller Pak provides more data storage capacity as well as portability. The Rumble Pak causes the Controller to vibrate, adding realism to the game.
