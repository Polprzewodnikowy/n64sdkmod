 <P>This manual describes the basic concepts of the N64 system configuration in simple terms. The purpose of this manual is to provide an overall understanding of N64 development concept.  Using the N64 Programming Manual and Functions Reference Manual (Man Pages) together with this manual, difficult areas may be overcome.<P>

This manual is composed of four sections, Steps 1-4.<p>

The step 1, (What is N64?) describes the overall hardware configuration. Step 2, (A Guide to the N64 Programming) describes basic programming concepts and directions for using tools to create the actual programs. Step 3, (N64 3D Graphics) describes the theory and practice of displaying 3D graphics as the most important factor of creating N64 applications. Step 4, (What is N64 Disk Drive?) describes the basic concepts for developing software supported by the N64 Disk Drive. (Please note that this device is supported, but not marketed in North America.)
Sample programs are included as appendices so that developers can approach practice smoothly.<P>

 This manual is edited as an introduction to make the introduction to N64 development relatively easy. We hope that it will assist the N64 Developer to create high quality N64 applications in an efficient manner.</u><BR>
