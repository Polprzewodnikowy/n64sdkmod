In STEP 3, "N64 3D Graphics," we will explain the theory and practical use of the basic matrix, coordinate system, etc.  Additionally, we will cover the 3D image, which is the most important factor for N64 application production. Our goal is to provide a basic understanding about the mathematical handling of the 3D image.  We have also included illustrations to help explain complicated areas.  Refer to these along with "The N64 Function Reference Manual," etc.  <BR>

A list of resources cited has also been attached at the end of the manual for your reference.<BR>
