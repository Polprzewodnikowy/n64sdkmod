<BR>
<BR>

   Basically, when you are working with 3D computer graphics, you are drawing pictures in a virtual three-dimensional space created in a computer, so your two-dimensional drawings have added depth information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, when you draw a two-dimensional picture on a computer, you draw dots by specifying the color of each pixel (picture element) with graphic tools as in this illustration:<P>

<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
However, when drawing a three-dimensional picture, you draw dots that have both color and depth (z axis) information. Because of this additional depth information, objects that lie behind other objects are partially or completely hidden as illustrated here:<P>

It looks like there is no difference between the two-dimensional final screen and the three-dimensional final screen. But the difference is obvious if you change the drawing order as shown here:<BR>
<BR>
Because the two-dimensional picture does not have the depth information, a picture drawn on top of another picture always wipes out what is underneath it. However, because the three-dimensional picture has depth information, the relationship between two objects holds regardless of the drawing order.<P>

Various objects exist in the three-dimensional space surrounding us.  As light falls on a three-dimensional object, some parts are lit up and other parts are dark or in the shadows. It all depends on the source and intensity of the light. Also, objects that are far away appear relatively small and appear to grow larger as they move closer and closer. To make objects appear three-dimensional, you need to apply these visual effects. <P>

Because 3D graphics data includes three-dimensional information, you can use computer calculations to apply appropriate 3D lighting and perspective effects. Moreover, you can use calculations to rotate and scale objects. These kinds of data manipulations by computer calculation are called <B>transformations</B>.<P>

<BR>
<BR>
The basic 3D graphics process is a three-step process. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>1. Create the model</B><BR>
<BR>


   First of all, you need to create the data for the object you want to draw. In general, an object to be drawn in computer graphics is called a <B>model</B> and the set of coordinates and other data belonging to a model is called <B>model data</B>.  To create model data effectively, you can use any of the many available 3D graphic tools called 3D Modelers. <BR>
You can also create model data on graph paper by hand, and then feed it into a computer. However, this method is complicated and requires a lot of work, therefore it is not a recommended way to create a large model.<P>

<BR>
<B>2. Convert the model data</B><BR>
<BR>
Next, you need to convert the model data, and place it in the virtual three-dimensional space of the computer. Then provide for the conversion calculations to show rotation, scale, movement, lighting, perspective, and so on. As a result of the conversion calculations, you can display a model that will be viewed from all directions. Moreover, it will be a solid image that has depth as shown by the lighting visual effects.<P>

<B>3. Display model on TV screen</B><BR>
<BR>
Finally, you need to send the model data in the virtual three-dimensional space of the computer to the TV screen by way of various software and hardware processes. Ultimately, when the converted model is displayed on a two-dimensional TV screen, the depth (z axis) information is no longer needed. Pixels (picture elements) are displayed on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
This conversion by the computer process has various aspects and produces a variety of effects.  For example, you can express a translucent object by taking into consideration the level of transparency when composing a screen.<P>
