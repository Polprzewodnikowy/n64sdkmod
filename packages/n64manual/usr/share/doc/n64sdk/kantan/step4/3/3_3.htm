   The 64DD emulator is available as a development environment which does not use the 64DD. Whenever changes are made to the program during normal debugging, it is necessary to overwrite the disk, and this takes time.
With the emulator, files on the hard disk can be executed and their operation checked without having to do a write operation, which signifcantly cuts back on debugging time. Since the emulator is only an approximate reproduction of the 64DD, a Development 64DD Drive should be used when doing debugging related to the physical operation of the 64DD. <BR>
