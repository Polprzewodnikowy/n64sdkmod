There are two types of 64DD drive: One for development use and the other for consumer use. Please note that these two types of drives have their own dedicated disks. <BR>
<ul>
<B><li>The Development-Use Drive : Disk Insertion Slot(Bezel) = Blue</li><BR>
          Disk = Blue</B>
<BR>
<B><li>The Consumer-Use Drive : Disk Insertion Slot(Bezel) = Black</li><BR>
          Disk = Grey</B>
</ul>
<B>Please be sure and use the appropriate type of disk with the proper drive. </B>The hardware of the two systems is different, and you can damage a drive if you insert the wrong kind
   of disk. <BR>
