<li>64DD is a dedicated magnetic disk drive that plugs into the expansion connector on the bottom of the N64 Control Deck. </li><BR><br>
<li>Its total disk capacity is 64MBytes, enabling the creation of large scale games not possible with just a ROM cartridge.</li><BR>
<BR>
<li>Part of the disk can be designated as a writable region from the game application, meaning the disk can also be used to back up player data.</li><BR><br>
</ul>In addition, by exchanging data stored on disks, games can be broadly expanded. <BR>
