<BR>
<BR>
<B>A value</B><BR>
->The alpha value.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Aliasing</B><BR>
When you display lines or polygons with the display equipment which has the limited pixels like TV, the stepped-notch is produced on the border of these lines or polygons.  zAliasing means these notches.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alpha compare</B><BR>
To synthesize the drawing, of the translucent polygon, and the pixel, this function compares the alpha value of pixel with the set threshold, and provides the conditional writing.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alpha dither compare</B><BR>
When the pixel alpha value is larger than the random dither value, it rewrites the frame buffer temporarily.  Because of this, it can affix the alpha gradiation on the surface and it implements the particle effect.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alpha value</B><BR>
The level of opacity.  The larger the alpha value is, the more opaque it becomes.<BR>
<BR>

<B>sbc</B><BR>
A tool creating a sequence bank file from some sequence files.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Semitone</B><BR>
A half tone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sequence player</B><BR>
The sequence player has two types; the MIDI sequence file player of Type 0 and the compact MIDI sequence player.  These players have the same functions except the compression format and the loop process.  While the MIDI sequence player of Type 0 can provide the loop process from outside, the compact MIDI sequence player need to embed the loop point inside of the sequence.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sequence position marker</B><BR>
It marks on a position of Type 0 sequence data and is used for setting the playing time or loop point.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sequencer</B><BR>
The device or software which continuously control the data arranged in order.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Small room</B><BR>
The sound effect that you hear the sound as if it were produced in a small room.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sound effect</B><BR>
The effective sound or music added to raise the atmosphere with the game image.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sound player</B><BR>
A player to play a single sound effect or streamed audio.  It can play the sound of the ADPCM compression or 16-bit non-compression format.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Stealing voice</B><BR>
The low-priority virtual voice, allocated by the physical voice once, is taken over by the high-priority or same-priority virtual voice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Streaming</B><BR>
To make the constant amount of sound data flow all the time by the real-time process.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Subtype byte</B><BR>
Stored the information which defines the MIDI event type.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sustain level</B><BR>
->ADSR<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tag</B><BR>
The attached information to identify data.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tap value</B><BR>
A coefficient (gain) for output of each effect which is output from the delay line.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tremolo</B><BR>
To provide the low frequency modulation to the sound quantity and change it large and small.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type 0/Type 1 MIDI</B><BR>
Forms of the MIDI sequence data.  A general MIDI sequencer uses a Type 1 MIDI file.  As the N64 audio library can only use the sequence data of Type 0 MIDI file, you need to convert to the Type 0 MIDI file by using midicvt.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Velocity</B><BR>
The rate to strike the keyboard.  Usually, the information indicating the sound quantity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vibration</B><BR>
One of the effect.  It makes the sound frequency (pitch) go up and down shake by the low frequency modulation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Virtual voice</B><BR>
Expressed using the ALVoice structure, this is for the player's convenience.  To play the sound, it needs to allocate players' virtual voices to the play-sound.  It allocates to the physical voice in order of high priority.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Volume</B><BR>
Loudness.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wave table</B><BR>
It provides the ADPCM compression to raw sound data and concludes it to a bank.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wet</B><BR>
The state manipulated by effect.  It can set from 0 to 127.  0 indicates sound dry completely and 127 indicates sound wet completely.<BR>
