<p> <strong>13.1 Changes from ver 2.0H to patchN64dd_082297(Unix) and patchPC_083197(PC)</strong> 

<hr>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoCreateLeoManager.htm">LeoCJCreateLeoManager()</a> and <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoCreateLeoManager.htm">LeoCACreateLeoManager( )</a> (initialization functions for Game Pak startup) have been added.
    <P>
    <li>The POWERONRESET_DEVICE_OCCURRED and MEDIUM_MAY_HAVE_CHANGED errors were previously reported only once from the leo manager.  In versions since 2.0H, each of these errors is continuously reported until the functions <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoResetClear.htm">LeoResetClear()</a> and <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoReadDiskID.htm">LeoReadDiskID()</a>, respectively, are issued.  (<a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoResetClear.htm">LeoResetClear()</a> is a newly added function.)<P>

    <li>LeoModeSelect() was changed from a synchronous function to an asynchronous function.  Accordingly, it was renamed <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoModeSelectAsync.htm">LeoModeSelectAsync()</a>.<P>

    <li>The function leoReset() was renamed <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoReset.htm">LeoReset( )</a>.<P>

    <li>The programs <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/n64mdisk.htm">n64mdisk</a>, used create master data, and <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/calcncc.htm">calcncc</a>, an NCC calculation program, were added.
 <P>

    <li>The library function <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoGetAAdr.htm">LeoGetAAdr2( )</a>, which acquires information related to ASCII font data, was added.  This function uses <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/asccode.htm"><font face="Century">asccode</font></a>, a utility that before compile time calculates data such as the locations of ASCII font data in DDROM. <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoGetAAdr.htm">LeoGetAAdr2( )</a>also uses the data obtained using <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/asccode.htm"><font face="Century">asccode</font></a>.
 <P>

    <li>The sample program ddspgame was added.  Previous samples tile_rect3d.disk/ and font/ were eliminated.
 <P>

    <li>Changes were made so that when <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoReadRTC.htm">LeoReadRTC( )</a> and <a href="../../n64man/64dd/LeoReadRTC.htm">LeoSetRTC( )</a> are issued, they do not report resets or disk exchanges even if they detect them.
  <P>

    <li>The LEO_ERROR_EJECTED_ILLEGALLY_RESUME error was added.
 <P>

    <li>The lba specification, used to specify the LBAs that arrange segments using <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/makedisk.htm"><font color="#FF0000">makedisk</font></a>, was enabled in the spec file. 
  <P>
