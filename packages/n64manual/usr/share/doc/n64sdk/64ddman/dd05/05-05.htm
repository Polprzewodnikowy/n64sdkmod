<strong>5.5 NCC Calculation </strong>


<p>The Nintendo Check Code, abbreviated NCC, is 6-digit decimal code used to check for problems such as data corruption when master code is submitted.  With desk games, it is computed individually for the ROM and RAM areas and submitted to Nintendo along with the MO containing the master data.</p>

<p>The tool <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/calcncc.htm">calcncc</a> is used for NCC calculation.  In the NW version, <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/calcncc.htm">calcncc</a> is installed in /usr/sbin/, and in the PC version it is installed in ultra\usr\sbin.  If <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/calcncc.htm">calcncc</a> master data filename is input, the NCC is individually calculated for ROM and RAM areas of the specified file and displayed on the screen.  master data filename can be omitted.  In this case, the NCC for the file master.d64 is computed (master.d64 is the name of the master data file that <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/n64mdisk.htm">n64mdisk</a> outputs.).
