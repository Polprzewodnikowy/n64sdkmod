Development Drive and Commercial Drive</strong>


<p>The drive used for development, called the development drive, has a blue bezel (disk slot) and uses a development disk (blue disk).  The commercially available drive (mass-production drive) has a black bezel and uses commercially available disks (usually gray).  The two types of drives differ in their hardware, so please avoid, for example, using a blue disk with a commercial drive or a commercial disk with a development drive.  Doing so may cause equipment failure.  Game programs that have been confirmed to work with the development drive are written to commercial disks by Nintendo.</p>
