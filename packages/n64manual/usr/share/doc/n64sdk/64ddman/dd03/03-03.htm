<p><strong>3.3 gwrite</strong>


<p>gwrite is a batch file that writes games to disk.  It is created by <a href="../../n64man/64dd/64ddtool/makedisk.htm"><font color="#FF0000">makedisk</font></a> (see Section <a href="03-01.htm">3.1</a>) and mild (see Section <a href="03-02.htm">3.2</a>).  It can be executed using the &#060 command (&#060  is a command that runs the commands contained in the specified file) as follows.


<p><strong>&gt;&lt;gwrite</strong></p>

<p>When gwrite is executed, the command leowrite, which is contained in gwrite, is executed several times.  Each leowrite execution corresponds to a segment and writes a segment in rom image to a specified LBA.  The general syntax of leowrite is as follows.</p>

<p><strong>&gt;leowrite -L 7 -w 125072-125311 -t 0 rom</strong></p>

<p>This command means to write from a file named rom, beginning at an offset of 125072 bytes from the beginning of the file to 125311 bytes (one segment), to a disk of type 0, beginning from LBA 7.  Disk type is discussed in detail in <a href="../dd11/index.htm">"Chapter 11, 64DD Hardware Specifications</a>."  It is sufficient here to understand that 1 of 7 types can be selected for each disk, the type corresponding to the size of the writable disk area.  Type 0 is one such type.
</p>

<p>leowrite is discussed in greater detail in <a href="../dd0d/index.htm">"APPENDIX D</a>."</p>
