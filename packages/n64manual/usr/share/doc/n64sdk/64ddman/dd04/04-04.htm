<P>
In systems that use 64DD, the disk cannot be accessed at the same time as another PI device.  Similarly, the disk cannot be accessed while font and wave data are accessed.  Thus, some means of performing these tasks must be established, such as pre-reading the required data into a buffer and then accessing the disk.
