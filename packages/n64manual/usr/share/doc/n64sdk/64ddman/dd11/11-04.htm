<strong>11.4 System Area</strong> 
<hr>

<p>The leo manager reserves tracks on the disk as a system area.  This area contains system-related information, such as the disk type (see section <a href="11-05.htm">11.5 Disk Types (ROM and RAM Areas)</a>) and the disk ID number (see <a href="../dd06/index.htm">Chapter 6: Disk ID</a>).
</p>

<p>The following is the information written to the system area.</p>

<p><strong>Disk Types </strong>

<p>This number determines the proportion of writable RAM area and read-only ROM area. For details, please see section <a href="11-05.htm">11.5, Disk Types(ROM and RAM Areas))</a>
</p>

<p><strong>IPL Size and Load Addresss</strong>

<p>When power to the 64DD is turned on, a demonstration is performed by the IPL, the program that starts games.  If the disk is inserted at this point, several blocks are automatically read, beginning from the starting block, and stored at a certain address in RDRAM.  The IPL size and the load address are the number of blocks to read initially and the location in RDRAM where the read programs and data are to be stored, respectively.  When loading is finished, the IPL performs various initialization tasks, then jumps to this load address.</p>

<p><strong>Disk ID</strong>

<p>A number used to identify individual disks.  For details, please see Chapter 6: Disk ID.</p>
