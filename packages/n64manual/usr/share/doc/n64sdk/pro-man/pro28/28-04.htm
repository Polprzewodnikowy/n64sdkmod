<h1>28.4 1M Flash Hardware Specifications</h1>
<hr>

<p>The hardware specifications of the Macronix 1M Flash currently used are as follows. 

<table cellpaDDING=0 cellspacing=6 border=0>
<tr><td>Sector Erase</td><td>typ:200ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>max:800ms</td></tr>
<tr><td>ALL Erase</td><td>typ:200ms</td><td>max:800ms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Write Array</td><td>typ:3ms</td><td>max:80ms</td></tr>
<tr><td>ALL Erase + ALL page write</td><td>typ:3s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>max:6s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Guaranteed Number of Rewrites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td colspan=2>100,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These specifications could be changed at some point in the future. 
<p>Actually, the majority of flash units can process at speeds higher than those shown as typical.  (Double-digit increases in the speed referred to above are possible depending upon the manufacturer of the flash or the version.)
As rewrites are repeated, the flash will get slower and the speed will not attain the maximum levels even within the guaranteed number of rewrites.  
<p>Based on the fact that there is a lot of variation in the flash speed with game programs, we need to be sure that, within the above maximum values, there are no fatal errors that could stop a game regardless of the flash speed.
