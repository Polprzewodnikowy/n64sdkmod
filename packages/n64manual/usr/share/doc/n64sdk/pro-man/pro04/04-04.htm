<h1>4.4 RCP Access Management </h1>

<p>The CPU has control over access to the RCP.  The RSP and RDP portions of the RCP can be used individually, or as a group. The CPU creates a task list that specifies what <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#microcode">microcode</a> to run and what command list to execute.  The task is then run on the RSP. </p>

<p>There are OS commands to start the task and to end (i.e.,  preempt) a task.  The RDP usually receives graphics <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#rendering" target="keywords">rendering</a> commands directly from the RSP.  However, it is also possible to drive the RDP from a list that is in DRAM. </p>
