<h1>9.5 DMA Engine Addressing</h1>

<p>As indicated above, the Nintendo 64 includes DMA engines that access DRAM directly.  Since these DMA operations are initiated by the CPU, the DRAM addresses passed to the interface routines are CPU <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#virtual address">virtual addresses</A>.
