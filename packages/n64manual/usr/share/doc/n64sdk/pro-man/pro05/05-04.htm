<H1>5.4 Music Composition </H1>

<p>Music composition involves creating midi sequences and then importing them into the game.  Midi sequences can be created using any of a variety of <a href="../../keywords/index/data/audio.htm#sequencer" target="keywords">sequencer</a> applications such as: Performer, Vision, Cubase, and MasterTracks, to name a few.  After the sequences are saved as <a href="../../keywords/index/data/audio.htm#MIDI" target="keywords">midi</a> files, they should be converted before being included in the game.  If you are planning to use the <a href="../../keywords/index/data/audio.htm#compressed MIDI" target="keywords">compressed MIDI</a> sequence player, the sequences should be run through midicmp.  If you are using the regular sequence player, the sequences are run through <A HREF="../../n64man/tool/midicvt.htm">midicvt</A>.  After the sequences are converted, they can be assembled into sequence banks with the sbk tool. This is optional, since midi sequences can be used without being part of a sequence bank.  To include the sequences in the game, a <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#segment">segment</A> containing the sequence data should be added to the spec file. (See the demo application "simple" for an example of this.)</p>

<P>To learn more about using sequences in a game, please see <A HREF="../pro17/index.htm">Chapter 17, "Audio Library"</A>
