<h1>5.1 Database Modeling</h1>
<P>
<p>To produce real-time 3D graphics, you need modeling tools to create <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#geometry" target="keywords">geometry</a> (three-dimensional coordinate data or a graphics form created by it). Since there are many modeling tools available on the market, there is no modeling package in the Nintendo 64 Development Kit from Silicon Graphics. Nintendo has contracted two top modeling package companies (MultiGen and Alias) to provide the database modeling solution. </p>

<p>For texture-map images and traditional 2D <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#sprite" target="keywords">sprite</a>-type games, you may desire image conversion, editing, and paint software.  Because these tools are commercially available, they are not provided as part of the Nintendo 64 Development Kit. </p>

<p>All of the example applications and source code, including sample image conversion programs, use the popular SGI RGB image format.  Additional related, but unsupported software, may be obtained from SGI via the 4Dgifts product, anonymous ftp via sgi.com, or from the user community on the Internet (see comp.graphics or the comp.sys.sgi hierarchy). One of the more popular publicly available packages containing image conversion and manipulation software is PBMPLUS, widely available on the Internet. </p>

<a name="01"><h2>5.1.1 NinGen</h2></a>

<p>NinGen is a 3D modeling package from MultiGen. It is a derivative of their traditional 3D modeling software, together with a Nintendo 64 database format converter.  The key strength of MultiGen has been their ability to provide 3D modeling tools for the real-time commercial and military flight/vehicle simulation market. </p>

<p>For this market, many database techniques developed for a real-time flight simulator are available in NinGen. Some basic features include: </p>

<ol>
  <li>geometric level of detail (<a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#LOD" target="keywords">LOD</a>:Level of Detail)
  <li>Binary separating planes for depth-ordered <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#rendering" target="keywords">rendering</a> (This is required if you don't use the <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#Z buffer" target="keywords">Z buffer</a>.)
  <li>Many <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#polygon" target="keywords">polygon</a> count reduction tools. The goal is the best model with the lowest polygon count.
</ol>

<a name="02"><h2>5.1.2 Alias</h2></a>

<p>Alias | wavefront has provided tools for the computer-generated film and animation market segment. Some of the basic features of the Alias software package include:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#NURBS" target="keywords">NURBs</a> based modeler provides smooth <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#surface" target="keywords">surfaces</a> on models.
  <li><a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#motion path" target="keywords">Motion Paths</a> and <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#inverse kinematics" target="keywords">inverse kinematics</a> provide complex motion. 
  <li>Special effects such as <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#particle system" target="keywords">particle systems</a>, a large variety of lights, and texturing capabilities improve picture quality.
</ol>

<a name="03"><h2>5.1.3 Other Modeling Tools</h2></a>

<p>In addition to Alias and MultiGen, there are other modeling packages on the market.  SoftImage, Nichimen Graphics N-World are also traditional film and animation market tool
suppliers.  For PC users, Autodesk's 3DStudio has recently entered the animation market on the low end of the price spectrum. </p>

<p>Film and animation tools have many features that can be extracted for real-time animation. Figuring out how to extract the special features out of these tools can help you give your game application an advantage.  For example, you might be able to use particle system tools to generate <a href="../../keywords/index/data/graphics.htm#texture map" target="keywords">texture maps</a>.  Flipping this texture book on some morphing geometry can approximate the group motion of a system of particles - enabling you to create fire, water, and other interesting objects. </p>

<a name="04"><h2>5.1.4 Custom Modeling Tools</h2></a>

<p>For special game application requirements, you may need to create your own custom modeling packages.  The advantage to creating your own modeling package is that you can customize the databases to the requirements of your game.  For example, you might be able to gain rendering display performance if you are able to give hints to your modeler about how to order geometry. </p>
