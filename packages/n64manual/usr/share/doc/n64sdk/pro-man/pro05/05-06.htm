<h1>5.6 Building ROM Images </h1>

<p>By using the <a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a> tool, you can pack your database and convert into final ROM images for the N64.  The N64 development environment heavily leverages the C compiler and <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#preprocessor">preprocessor</a> tools to process symbolic data into binary objects.  A ROM packing tool, makerom, packs these objects into a single monolithic ROM image according to a specification of where these objects go. </p>

<a name="01"><h2>5.6.1 C Compiler Suite </h2></a>

<p>Currently, the Nintendo 64 development environment has only been verified with the IRIX 5.3 MIPS C-compiler suite.</p>

<p>The interfaces provided do not rely on proprietary features of this compiler; however backend tools such as makerom may rely on specifics of the MIPS symbol table format.
It is required that all modules be compiled or assembled with the -non_shared and -G 0 compilation flags; neither <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#position independent code">position independent code</a> or a <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#global data area">global data area</A> is supported.  Since the MIPS R4300 supports the MIPS II instruction set, the -mips2 flag is also recommended, as are optimization flags (-O and -O3). </p>

<a name="02"><h2>5.6.2 ROM Image Packer</h2></a>

<p>The ROM image packer (<a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a>) takes as input relocatable objects created by the compiler, and performs the final relocations of code symbols.  To perform these relocations, <a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a> invokes a next generation link editor that allows objects to be linked at arbitrary addresses specified by the developer. After these relocations, <a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a> extracts the code and initialized data portions of the resulting binary and packs them onto a ROM image. The <a href="../../n64man/tool/makerom.htm">makerom</a> tool can also copy raw data files to the ROM as desired. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  When building a ROM image for the console (as opposed to the development system), be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>link with libultra.a and not libultra_d.a 
  <li>remove all calls to printf and its variations from your application 
  <li>remove any functions specific to the development board (such as command line parsing or logging) from your application
</ul>

<a name="03"><h2>5.6.3 Headers and Libraries </h2></a>

<p>Although the Nintendo 64 <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#API">API</A> includes interfaces for a wide variety of areas, the interfaces are made available by including a single header file, /usr/include/ultra64.h, and by linking with a single library, /usr/lib/libultra.a (or /usr/lib/libultra_d.a).  The library routines are broken into their finest level of granularity, so applications only select routines that are actually necessary. </p>

<p>There are two versions of the Nintendo 64 library: a debug version (/usr/lib/libultra_d.a) and a non-debug version (/usr/lib/libultra.a).  The debug version of the library provides additional run time checks at the expense of some space on the ROM and DRAM, as well as some performance.  The kinds of checks performed include argument checking (especially hard to find alignment problems), improper use of interfaces, audio resource problems, etc.  It is recommended that the debug library be used in initial development, and then replaced by the non-debug library later in the development cycle. </p>

<p>In case of an error, the game loading program gload will interpret and display the errors on the host.</p>
