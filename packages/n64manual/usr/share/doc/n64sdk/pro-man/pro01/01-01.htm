<h2><a name="02">1.1.2 Connecting the Emulator Board</a></h2>

<p>The board is secured in the workstation by four screws that attach it to the standoffs on the base board.</p>

<p>The Nintendo 64 Development board is not supported by the hinv command. Once the board and software have been successfully installed, reboot the system. The power up boot monitor will echo &QUOT;64 Device found&QUOT; during the power-up procedure. The application ginv in /usr/src/PR/demos/ginv can be used to print information about the installed development board such as the RCP version number, clock speed, and video mode.</p>

<p>The AV out port connector type is the same as that used on the current Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
The same cables for the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System are used as well. However, RGB cables cannot be used. When a particular format of cables need to be supported (when developing games for PAL version), different kinds of formats my be used for cables.</p>

<p>The AV out can optionally be routed back to the Indy video input and audio inputs, allowing you to view and hear the game board on the local Indy workstation. The workstation accepts composite or S-video input as provided on separate SHVC cables. </p>

<p>Connect moduler-N64 Controller Connector converting board to game controller ports. There are 6 connectors in the port.  The connectors are named 1 through 6 from left to right (when you view the connector from the back of the workstation). Connect the converting board to the ports 1 through 5. Once the converting board is connected, connect N64 Standard Controller to the board.</p>
