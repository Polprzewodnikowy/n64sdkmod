<h1>20.6 General MIDI and the Nintendo 64</h1>

<p>Although the N64 is not specifically a General MIDI device, it can be configured as one. As part of the developer's kit, there is a General MIDI Bank that demonstrates this. All the sound files used in this <a href="../../keywords/index/data/audio.htm#bank" target="keywords">bank</a> are also provided and may be used by licensed developers in any N64 project. </p>

<p>Currently, MIDI channel 10 is configured to default to program 128. In the General Midi Bank, this is the Standard Drum Kit. If you send a program change on channel 10, the specified program will be selected, and channel 10 will no longer be the Standard Drum Kit. </p>
