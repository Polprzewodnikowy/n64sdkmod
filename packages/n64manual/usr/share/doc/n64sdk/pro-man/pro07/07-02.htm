<H1>7.2 System Threads, Application Threads, and the Idle Thread </H1>

<p>There are several types of <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#thread">threads</A> in a typical application. There is a distinction (using priority) between <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#system thread">system threads</A>, application threads, and the <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#idle thread">idle thread</A>.</p>

<P>The PI manager, described in <A HREF="../pro08/index.htm">Chapter 8 "Input/Output Functionality</A>," is typical of system threads.  It acts as a resource manager, allowing multiple user threads to share a critical resource
safely - in this case, the cartridge ROM.  </p>

<P>The idle thread, which has the lowest priority (a priority of 0) of any thread in the system, runs only when all other threads are blocked awaiting some <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#event">event</A>. Note that the idle thread is required; the system will not run without it. The game application itself is composed of user threads. User threads are defined as those threads having priorities
between 1 and 127. </p>
