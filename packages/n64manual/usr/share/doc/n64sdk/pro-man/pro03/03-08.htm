<h1>3.8 Development Hardware</h1>

<p>The development system consists of an N64 game card on a GIO card for the Indy workstation.  The ROM cartridge is replaced by 16 megabytes of RAM, called the
ramrom, that is accessible from both the Indy workstation through the GIO bus and the RCP through the PBUS.  The workstation downloads the game software on to the GIO card
and then the N64 executes the game.   The ramrom is also used to pass information to the debugger. The 4 megabytes of main memory uses the 9 bit RDRAMs.</p>
