<h1>6.9 Debugging Support </h1>

<p>In addition to support for the high-level GameShop Debugger <a href="../../n64man/tool/gvd.htm">gvd()</a>, the operating system also provides additional useful facilities for debugging.  Developers can use convenient routines to log <A target="keywords" HREF="../../keywords/index/data/system.htm#message">messages</a> to pre-allocated buffers for delayed transfers to the host Indy.   Since this logging utility has low performance impact, it may be well suited for debugging real-time problems or running performance analysis.  Developers can also use the printf-like utility <a href="../../n64man/os/osSyncPrintf.htm">osSyncPrintf()</a> to display text formatted messages on the host Indy.</p>
