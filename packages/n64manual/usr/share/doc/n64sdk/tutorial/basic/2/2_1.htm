 When creating an N64 application, the program is written using the C language.  The assumption is that you have already learned C, so it should not be difficult to understand the development language itself.  However, since you are putting together a different style program than what is common in C programming, we will start with an explanation so you can get accustomed to this style.<BR><BR>
     At this point, it should be easy to write user programs using NuSystem, but there are still some things that you need to understand.  With the help of  the sample program "basic2," which is the most basic of programs with a minimum of functions, we will address such general questions as "How is an N64 program executed?" and "What is  the best way to write an N64 program?".<BR><BR>  
     The aim of this chapter is to give you a basic sense of N64 programming.
