<p>The sounds, voices and sound effects that make up the audio performance are an essential part of the production of an application.
     This tutorial covers the makeup of N64 audio and explains the use of programs that use the special library, mainly through examples with the N64 Sound Tools.

     <p>The N64 Sound Tools comprise a tool environment featuring excellent controllability and the MUSIC Library (MUS library), a top-notch audio library.  The programmer can develop audio for the N64 very easily with this library so there is almost no need for direct use of the N64 OS audio functions.
