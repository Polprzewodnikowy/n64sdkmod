Next we'll talk about the middle three items in this display screen.  These items represent the number of channels secured for songs, the number of channels secured for sound effects, and the total number of channels, respectively.  This does not refer to the number of channels secured for use in real time, but rather the maximum number of channels for use for the various songs and sound effects that are secured when playback starts and are released when playback ends.
</P>
The bottom four items are explained below:<BR>
