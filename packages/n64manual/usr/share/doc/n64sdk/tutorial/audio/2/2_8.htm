<B>SONG1</B><BR>
This sample concerns reverb, as explained in "Section 2.6, Effects (Reverb)."  When the settings are changed, the specified reverb takes effect at that time.  To get a real feel for the reverb effect, move the pan to the left and then playback.</P>

<B>SONG2</B><BR>
 This sample plays back a song in which synchronization markers have been set.  The background color changes when a marker is reached.

<B>SE1</B><BR>
 In this sample, the sound effect's volume and pan can be changed by moving the Control Stick while the sound effect is playing.  Generate the sound effect by selecting SE1 and pressing the A button, and then try moving the Control Stick around and see what happens.

<B>SE2</B><BR>
In this sample, you select SE2 and press the A button to playback the specified sound effect with MusStartEffect.  The specified sound effects have been set with the "random option" function on Sound Tools to have changing pan and volume.

<P>
<B>SE3</B><BR>
 Select SE3 and press the A button to hear engine sounds.  Change the engine revolutions by moving the Control Stick <img src="../up.gif"> <img src="../down.gif"> .  When the revolutions drop below 2000 the sound effect changes to an engine stall.
