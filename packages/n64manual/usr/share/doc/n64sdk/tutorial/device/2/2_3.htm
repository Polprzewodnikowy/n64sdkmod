<P>
The 64DD disk has a large capacity of about 64 Mbytes.  You can split the disk into a read-only area (ROM area) and a writable area (RAM area) with a maximum size of 38 Mbytes.
     With the 64DD system, it is possible to use a Game Pak and a disk at the same time, and media can be exchanged during game play.  A system area is reserved on the disk for writing such information as the disk type and the disk ID.  <br><br>

     The only way to access the 64DD with the N64 OS Leo function series is at the block level using LBAs.  To make this easier to use, a file system called the MultiFileSystem (abbreviated as "MFS" henceforth) has been prepared.  By using the MFS you can access the 64DD in units of files.
