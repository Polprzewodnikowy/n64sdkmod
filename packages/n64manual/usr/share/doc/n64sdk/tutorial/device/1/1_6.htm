<P>
Next we will try running the sample programs which utilize the preceding functions.
     When you run the sample programs from \n64kit\sample\tutorial\device\64devsi, the SI Device Test main menu is displayed on the screen.<br><br>  
     Select a menu item with the Control Pad <img src="../up.gif"> <img src="../down.gif"> , and then press the Start button.  Pressing the Start button again takes you back to the main menu from each submenu.<br><br>
 Below a summary of each submenu has been provided:
</P>
<P>
<B>Controller</B><BR>
  Detects which buttons have been pushed.  When a Controller button is pushed, the corresponding indicator turns to red for "PRESSED", or flashes red momentarily for "TRIGGER."
</P>
<P>
<B>Controller Pack</B><BR>
 Select this menu after you have inserted a Controller Pak.  This is a simple sample of Save, Load and Delete with the Controller Pak.  Select using <img src="../up.gif"> <img src="../down.gif"> on the Control Pad, change the value using  on the Control Pad, and then execute with the A button.  Try saving a value for H.P. and M.P.  Then change the value, load, and check if the previously saved value is displayed.  The value can be changed using RIGHT/LEFT on the C button unit.
     (In NuSystem versions earlier than 1.2, the "Delete" will fail because of a bug in <tt>nuContPakFileDeleteJis</tt>.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Motor</B><BR>
 Remove the Controller Pak and insert the Rumble Pak into the Controller.  Change the value using the Control Pad <img src="../left.gif"> <img src="../right.gif">, and start and stop the vibrations with the A Button.  Vary the vibration strength by changing the value of "Frequency."  The value can be set between 1 and 256, and the vibration time is 5 seconds.  The A Button alternately starts and stops the vibrations.  If you press the A Button while the Rumble Pak is vibrating the vibrations will stop.
