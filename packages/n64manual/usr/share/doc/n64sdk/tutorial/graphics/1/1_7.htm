<P>
  The explanations in this chapter were somewhat concise, but managed to mention actual computations performed by the RSP and programs that use the RSP.<br><br>
     If you take a look at the gfx.1 sample source you will notice a number of commands that we have not explained at all.  Yet, all of these commands are named with the gDP* convention and are related to the RDP.  We will begin explaining the RDP in the next chapter and bring up a number of gDP* commands.  If you can get a firm grasp on each of these commands as you read through this tutorial, you will gain a deep understanding of how to use all of the essential commands as well as the hardware architecture that lies behind them.
<br><br>
     Moreover, some of the gSP* commands that we could not explain here will be brought up in later chapters.  The geometry mode setting commands gSPClearGeometryMode and gSPSetGeometryMode will be covered in detail in the next chapter, and commands relating to textures will be clearly explained in Chapters 3 and 9.
<br><br>
     The structures and commands relating to graphics are all defined in &lt;gbi.h&gt (though things relating to the S2DEX sprite microcode are in &lt;gs2dex.h&gt;).  Take a look at &lt;gbi.h&gt if you want to learn how the macros are implemented and how the various constants are defined.  You may also want to check out the header file as needed so you can gain a full understanding.
