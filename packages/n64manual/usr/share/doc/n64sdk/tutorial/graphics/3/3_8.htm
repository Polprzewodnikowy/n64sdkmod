<P>
  In this last section, we provide a simple explanation about the various mode settings in the gfx3.c sample program.
     First of all, the only thing specified for geometry mode is G_CULL_BACK.  In other words, none of the shading functions are used.
      The combine mode is set to G_CC_DECALRGB.  A detailed explanation of combine mode will be given in Chapter 4, so here we will only note that when the mode is set to G_CC_DECALRGB only the texture color and alpha value are used.  That is why there is no need to specify G_SHADE for geometry mode.<br><br>
	The rendering mode is set to G_RM_OPA_SURF and G_RM_OPA_SURF2, as always.   We will continue to use these settings until Chapter 5, so for now no explanation for the rendering mode will be provided.
