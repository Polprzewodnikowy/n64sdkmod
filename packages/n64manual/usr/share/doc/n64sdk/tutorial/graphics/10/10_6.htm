<P>
This completes the Graphics part of the N64 Tutorial.  We brought up a variety of issues and provided some detailed explanations where we needed to delve into a topic.  By reading this tutorial and applying its concepts, you should be able to create some advanced N64 graphics applications.<br><br>
     At first glance, this Graphics Tutorial may have impressed you as focusing exclusively on explanations pertaining to 3D graphics.  But in fact, a comprehensive understanding of the functionality of the RDP also helps when rendering 2D graphics (texture rectangles and sprite microcode).<br><br>

     Although we did not touch on this subject in the tutorial, to make your work more efficient we suggest using the Nintendo Intermediate File Format (NIFF) as the intermediate format for storing data created with CG Tools, which is readily available on the market.  To learn more about this, see the NIFF Manual in Allmanual.<br><br>

     We would like to conclude by hoping you can all create high quality games with the techniques you have learned with the help of this tutorial.
