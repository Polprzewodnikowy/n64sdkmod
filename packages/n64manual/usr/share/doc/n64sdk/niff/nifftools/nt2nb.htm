<P>Converts NIFF text into binary

<P>
<b>Syntax</b>
<font face="courier" size="2">
<blockquote><pre>nt2nb input-file output-file</pre></blockquote></font>

<P>
<b>Description</b>
<P>
Reads the text file input-file and outputs it to the NIFF data file output-file.<p>
This command can convert the data output in text format by nb2nt into NIFF binary data.
<ul>
 <li> Everything below ";" is a comment and is thrown out when the file is read
 <li> The read data is a list of integers and real numbers, but it corresponds to a list of NIFF binary data
 <li> If the list of numerical data is not wrong, then it does not matter whether the other character strings are correct or not. 
 <li> If the first character in a string is - or 0~9, the string is judged to be numerical data. After the string has been judged to be numerical data, it is read as "floating" if there is a decimal point.
 <li> The part bounded by &lt;List name&gt &lt/Listname&gt is read as that List, and it does not matter what is written outside of its delimiters.
</ul>

Basically, each numeric written in text format and delimited by spaces is converted into 4 bytes of binary data. Character strings that are not numerics are skipped.<p>
Texture data and NameList are not 4 byte data, so these are given special treatment. Please refer to the output of nb2nt. 

<P>
<b>Notes</b>
<P>
If there are errors in the data list, sometimes the file cannot be converted.<p>

Because floating data is rounded off with nb2nt, you cannot be certain you have returned to the original data when using nt2nb.
