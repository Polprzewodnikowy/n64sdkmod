<b>1. NIFF 2.0 Environment
</b>

<P>
In addition to the previous NIFF environment, the new release of NIFF 2.0 environment is designed for taking full advantage of the NVF
library, its application tool "nvfview" previewer and the NIFF to NVF converter "niff2nvf."
<P>
Also, the NIFF API support library and its basic application libraries, called NIFF Tools, enable users to customize NIFF 2.0.
<p>
Off course, previous NIFF 1.0 files can be used by the tools described above. In actual game development, these tools would be essential.
<p>
Updated "niff2gfx" and "n64prev" are included for the user who already uses niff2gfx + nd.<p>
The following list describes the contents of this release.
