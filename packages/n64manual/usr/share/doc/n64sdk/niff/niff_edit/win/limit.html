<p>Please note the following items when using NIFF Editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a NIFF file is opened and then saved with NIFF Editor, the original NIFF file and the saved NIFF file may differ, even when the link information and the flag information for the file have not been edited. This is because NIFF Editor assigns index numbers which are linked to each node when it saves a NIFF file. However, since the link data and the flag data are not changed during this process, using this saved file will not pose a problem.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>When using n64prev Previewer, Quick Previewer and nvfview Previewer, <i>please use NLOAD.EXE version 1.03p or later in IS-Viewer64</i>. Version 1.03p and later versions do not execute makemask in the n64prev Previewer, Quick Previewer and nvfview Previewer executable files in consideration of the fact that makemask will be automatically performed when a file is loaded. If the version of IS-Viewer64 that you have is older than 1.03p, please download the latest version from the NOA Engineering Website at <A HREF="http://www.noa-engineering.com">www.noa-engineering.com</A>. However, you can still use a version of IS-Viewer 64 older than 1.03p by adding makemask to the executable files.
</ul>

<p>Following is a description of known issues and unincorporated functions in the current version of NIFF Editor. These issues will be resolved in successive version updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>When re-attaching a node's links with drag'n'drop, the nodes that had until then been closed in the Tree View will be re-opened and focus will shift to the scene node
<P>
<li>NIFF Editor does not support scrolling with the IntelliMouse wheel operating under Windows 95.
</ul>
