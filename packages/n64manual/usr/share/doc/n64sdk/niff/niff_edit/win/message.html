<p>NIFF Editor generates two kinds of messages: <a href="#warning">Warning messages</a> and <a href="#error">Error messages</a>.</p>
<p>Warning messages enable the user to either proceed or terminate some process.  When a warning is generated while using NIFF Editor, a message box similar to the one below is displayed. Click [Yes] to execute the task explained in the message and continue  processing. Click [No] to terminate without executing the task.</p>

<div align="center">

<p>An error message is generated when execution of a process cannot proceed.  The cause of the error must be found and resolved.  Refer to the explanations below for each error message and take the appropriate measures.</p>
