<p>NIFF Editor is a tool for editing the link information and flag information contained in NIFF files output by commercial graphics tools that support the Nintendo Intermediate File Format (NIFF).</p>

<p>A NIFF file is an intermediate format file which contains all of the scene data made with the graphics tool.  Though the data is in binary format, it is not advisable to directly create or edit the information in the NIFF file with a binary editor.  NIFF Editor provides an easy way to edit NIFF files.  For example, changing node link information becomes a simple Drag & Drop procedure using NIFF Editor, and flag information can be edited in the various node properties dialog boxes.</p>

<p>Additionally, with IS-VIEWER64 you can preview NIFF files on the NINTENDO<font size="-1"><sup>64</sup></font> system while editing. NIFF Editor now support NIFF 2.0 Specification NIFF files. It can perform node operations for the Chain Root, Joint and Effector nodes added in NIFF 2.0, and it enables conversion and previewing with the niff2nvf Converter and the nvfview Previewer.</p>
