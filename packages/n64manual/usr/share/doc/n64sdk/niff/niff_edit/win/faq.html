<p>Below are some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) concerning the use of NIFF Editor.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="faq1"><strong>How do I update to the latest version of NIFF Editor?</strong></a>
<dd><p>Support for NIFF Editor is available at the <a href="http://www.noa-engineering.com">NOA Engineering website</a>. 
You can download the latest version of NIFF Editor from the site. </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="faq2"><strong>I updated NIFF Editor but nothing seems to have changed.</strong></a>
<dd><p>If NIFF Editor has been previously installed, you must delete all of the files and sub-directories located in the following directory:<p>

c:/nintendo/n64kit/niff/bin/niffedit &nbsp; (this is the default location)<p>
..prior to installing a new version of the software.
<p>

<dd><p>To delete NIFF Editor, from the Start button menu choose Settings, Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs. Follow the on screen instructions to delete NIFF Editor.</p>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="faq3"><strong>How do I change the home page address displayed in Online Support in the [Help] menu?</strong></a></p>

<dd><p>The Online Support home page address is set with the following Registry key:</p>

<p>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Intelligent Systems/NIFF Editor/Settings/OnlineAddress
<p>

<p>Edit this key to specify a new address.  Before doing so, carefully backup the existing Registry since changes can lead to problems with NIFF Editor and possibly Windows.</p>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="faq4"><strong>When I select [Quick Preview] from the [Tools] menu, I can't preview.</strong></a>
<dd><p>When Quick Preview is selected, NIFF Editor executes the quickprev.bat file.  This batch file describes a process for IS-VIEWER64 to load the NIFF file without first having to perform makemask.  This works because the makemask function is contained in nload.exe, for versions 1.02t and later. If you are using a version of nload.exe created prior to version 1.03, you won't be able to preview files with IS-VIEWER64 because makemask will not be performed.</p>
<p>If you are using a version of nload.exe created prior to version 1.03p, please add makemask process to the quickprev.bat file or download the latest version of nload.exe from the <a href="http://www.noa-engineering.com">NOA Engineering website</a>.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>An application error occurs when click events or drag & drop events are performed on the right side window of NIFF Editor. </strong>
<dd><p>This error occurs when the version of comctl32.dll, Windows system file is 4.00.950.  This error can be avoided by updating comctl32.dll in one of the following ways.
<P>
<ul>
<li>comctl32.dll is updated by installing Internet Explorer of version 3.0 or later. If Internet Explorer is uninstalled, comctl32.dll will not be removed.
<P> 
<li>Download the program to update comctl32.dll from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/downloads/files/40Comupd.htm" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>
</ul>

<p>Windows 95 later than OSR2, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 contains comctl32.dll that doesn't produce this error.</p>
