<br>      
       The startup script filename has been changed from "ne" to "ne2", and the NIFFeditor program filename has been changed from "niffeditor" to "niffeditor2". NIFF 1.0 files are compatible with versions of NIFFeditor up to and including version 1.35, and may be used with the old startup script ("ne") and program ("niffeditor").
       <br>New NIFF2tool menu has been added.
       <br>The number of displaying nodes has been increased to support the nodes added in NIFF 2.0.
       <br>The node setting dialogue box has been modified to support the nodes added in NIFF 2.0.
       <br>The N64 menu is disabled while reading a NIFF 2.0 file.
       <br>Internally, it was changed so that NIFFAPI is used. The change of NIFFAPI will be reflected.
      <br>
      A file can be opened while loaded data is deleted automatically, (the flow is now [File]-[Open]). Thus, the data does not have to be deleted manually in prior to open a file, (the previous flow was [file]-[New]-[Open}).
