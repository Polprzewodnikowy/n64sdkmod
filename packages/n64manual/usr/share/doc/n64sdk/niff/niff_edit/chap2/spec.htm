<ul>
<li>The NIFF data nodes that are displayed are Scene, Obj, Shape, Part, Mat, Tex, EnvCam, Light, and Anim. The names and settings for all of these nodes can be viewed and edited in dialog boxes.
<p>
<li> Links that can be moved, added, and deleted are those between any two of the following objects: scene-obj, obj-obj, obj-shape, obj-mat, obj-anim, shape-mat, part-mat, and mat-texure. <p>
<li> When EditMode is OFF, you cannot paste, add, or delete links, nor can you modify various node attributes.
<P>However, it is possible to overwrite files and change the convert options.
<p>
<font color=#FF0000>When EditMode is OFF, the data cannot be changed. If you try to change the data and nothing happens, check whether EditMode is OFF.</font><p>
<li>After changing mat_type between NIFF<->N64 in the Mat dialog box, you must close the dialog box and then re-open it to ensure that
        the data which existed prior to the change does not remain on the screen, together with the color_type* and alpha_type* data.
<p>
<li>Regarding the texture display on the Tex node:<p>
      <ul>
       <li>It may be displayed in a different color from the actual image.
       <li>When a large amount of data is required for animating the texture, the data set at the beginning is displayed. 
      </ul>
<p>
 <li>After Ver1.32, markemask is not used during creation of the ROM image file for IS-VIEWER. The new version of nload(1.35) executes ROM images that have not been processed with makemask.
<font color=red>Please note that the old version(1.32) of nload cannot execute these ROM image files. </font>
</ul>
