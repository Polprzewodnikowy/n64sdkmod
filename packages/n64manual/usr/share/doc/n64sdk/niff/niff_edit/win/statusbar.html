When a menu item is selected, simple Menu-specific help is displayed at the left end of 
the status bar.
<P>
The right end of the status bar indicates whether the open file has been revised with NIFF Editor by pasting links or changing flags, etc.  If the file has been revised, then "Modified" is displayed at the right end of the Status Bar.  If there have been no revisions to the file, (i.e. the file was recently opened) nothing is displayed in this area.


<p>Show or hide the status bar by toggling the [Status bar] command in the [View] menu.</p>
