<u>6. Handling of Materials in NIFF (#2)</u>
<P>
Materials mainly consist of attributes of shapes or parts such as color, light, or shading type, and links to textures.
<p>
In NIFF, a color attribute is selected from vertex colors,  triangle colors,  primitive colors,  or texture colors.  However, in order to convert to the graphics data for Nintendo 64, there are some restrictions.
<p>
When performing a lighting treatment, color data cannot be used as vertex color.  That's because Nintendo 64 cannot use a vertex color when specifying a normal vector.  And for a triangle color,  we need to mix the color of light for each color with a triangle color when converting it into data for Nintendo 64,  or we need to convert once again as a primitive color.  Therefore, if we consider performing a lighting treatment and efficiency in editing NIFF data,  we suggest when specifying a lighting treatment you should divide each part by the same color, and use a primitive color in materials linked to the part.  If done so, by editing the material node,  you can change the information on the primitive color which has a link to the material at once, improving the efficiency.
