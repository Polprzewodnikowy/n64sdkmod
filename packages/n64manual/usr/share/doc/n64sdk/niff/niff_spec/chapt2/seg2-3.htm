<u>3. Hierarchical Structure of 3D Objects</u>
<P>
The objects in 3D games have a hierarchical structure, in many cases .  For instance, consider the example illustrated below.
<p>

<p>
Figure: Object with Hierarchical Structure
</center>
<p>
<P>
This example is an object comprised from 11 objects (hypothetically named Man_Object).  As an example, if the Man_Hip object in the above figure is the top level object, the links between the objects would be as shown below.
<P>
<center>
<img src="./hrc_link.gif">
<p>
Figure: Hierarchical Links in an Object
</center>
<p>
In the case of the above figure, the origin of this Man_Object would be matched to the local coordinate system of the Man_Hip object.  However, since Man_Object would normally have its own local coordinate system, and it could be imagined that Man_Hip would be animated in that coordinate system, Man_Object is defined as a NULL object and is linked as shown below.
