      is a complete, feature-rich, windows- based, game development and debugging environment
      for N64 game developers. The hardware attaches right to your PC and the software runs in
      Windows 95 or Windows NT and includes the exe GCC compiler customized for the N64.</font></td>

    <font size="2"><p><strong><font face="Arial">Better Games with Fewer Bugs</font></strong><br>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">The Partner-N64PC debugging process makes it easier to find
    the bugs in your games. You'll have more time to focus on the design and features of your
    games.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <font size="2"><p><font face="Arial"><strong>Improved Productivity</strong><br
    clear="left">
    With Partner-N64PC, you can automate routine portions of the debugging process with
    macros. The powerful macro language uses a C-like control structure (If, For, While, Do,
    Break, and so on), so you can define new commands or combine commands with breakpoints.
    Using the macro language, you can develop and run a professional automated debugging
    system. The macro language makes it easy to develop reusable debugging suites.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Other powerful features in Partner-N64PC also help you improve your
    productivity. For example, using the On-the-Fly feature, you can enter certain commands
    while the game program is running. You can use this feature to view and change memory,
    I/O, and register contents. You can also measure game program execution times in
    microseconds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Use source-level debugging to debug Assembler code, debug games
    developed for the N64 Disk Drive, or to support all video formats. With a single key, you
    can specify a breakpoint or execute a game program up to the cursor thus eliminating the
    need for symbolic debugging.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">Easy Debugging in 12+ Windows</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Debugging is easier using windows. With Partner-N64PC, you can use
    the following 12 windows:<ul>
      <li>Two Code windows to see source code or combined source and Assembler </li>
      <li>Command window to enter commands and macros and to show results </li>
      <li>Memory window to see memory data </li>
      <li>Register window to see register contents </li>
      <li>Stack window to see stack contents </li>
      <li>Local window to see contents of local variables when a break occurs </li>
      <li>Watch window to see stored watch data </li>
      <li>Backtrace window to see the backward trace of a C function </li>
      <li>Break window to see the currently set breakpoints </li>
      <li>Inspect window to inspect and display the contents of variables </li>
      <li>Memo window to enter notes while you're debugging </li>
      <li>No New Equipment to Buy</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial">You can develop, test, and debug your N64 games right there on your
    Windows 95 desktop.&nbsp; Support for NTSC, PAL, &amp; M/PAL.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Partner-N64PC comes with an NTSC Modified N64 Control Deck as the
    target device. You can easily switch to PAL or M/PAL development by simply switching to a
    PAL or M/PAL Modified N64 Control Deck (available separately from Nintendo) to achieve the
    correct video format.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Many Powerful Features!</font></p>
