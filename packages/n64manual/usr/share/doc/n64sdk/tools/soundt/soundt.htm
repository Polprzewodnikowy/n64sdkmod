    </small><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Use N64 Sound Tools to create the best music and
    sound effects for your N64 games. N64 Sound Tools is a complete, self-contained audio
    development environment for the PC. With N64 Sound Tools, a musician can edit the music
    and then hear exactly how the edited music or sound effect will sound on the N64. Because
    the playback occurs on the N64, a musician can hear what additional changes need to be
    made. </font></td>

    <br>
    <u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Better Sound for Your Games</font></u><br>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It&#146;s easy for a musician to fine tune music and sound
    effects or add qualities that don&#146;t exist in MIDI. For example, the musician can
    attach musical effects to notes including vibrato, portamento, sample trigger on/off, and
    ADSR. <br>
    <br>
    <u>Easier Track &amp; Channel Control</u></font><br>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Using the features available in N64 Sound Tools, you can
    easily control the tracks and their use of audio channel resources. You could do this in
    MIDI, but it's much easier to do using the N64 Sound Tools intuitive user interface. </font><p

    align="left"><u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Easier to Mix Audio &amp; Game Code</font></u><br>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">When you finish editing your audio in the Sequencer, you
    simply save the completed sound data files for the programmer to add to the game code. You
    develop for the N64 system directly on the N64 system. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Reduced Compile Times</font></u><br>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Because the data format used to store musical data is much
    more powerful and memory-efficient than can be easily achieved using MIDI files, compile
    time will be minimized. </font></td>
    <td width="4%" valign="top" align="right"></td>
    <td width="71%" valign="top" align="left"><u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Improved
    Productivity for Both Programmer and Musician</font></u><br>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The programmer, game designer, and musician can work together
    from the beginning to plan resource allocation settings and values. </font><p><font

    FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The musician can use the Waveform Editor (included) to edit
    waveforms quickly and easily using the intuitive user interface. In addition, the musician
    can organize sets of waveforms into appropriate groups, transfer single or multiple
    samples from external MIDI samplers, and use batch processing to perform several processes
    on multiple waveforms during an operation. </font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The musician can use the Sequencer (included) to edit and
    fine tune musical arrangements and effects productively by using several built-in editors
    (track editor, key editor, drum editor, and score editor). During the editing process, the
    musician can play back the piece immediately on the N64 to hear exactly how it will sound,
    and make any additional changes needed. </font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">When the musician saves the edited music, N64 Sound Tools
    creates the sound data files. The programmer then simply adds these files directly to the
    game code. </font></td>
