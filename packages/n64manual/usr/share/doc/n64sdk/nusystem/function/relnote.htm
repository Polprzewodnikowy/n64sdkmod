<H2>History of Revisions to the Standard Function Library (<TT>libnustd.a</TT>)</H2>

<P><B>Revision from V1.3 (Jan 13 2000)</B></P>
<P>- Added "F" to each value because float constants such as FVAL_* of mathdef.h were handled as double without any changes.</P>
<P><B>Revision from V1.2 (Jul 13 1999)</B></P>
<P>- Added #pragma intrinsic to sqrt,fabs,fabsf of math.h.  When IRIX6.2 or newer versions are used, these functions will be in-line expanded.</P>
<P>
<B>Revision from V1.1 (May 11 1999)</B>

<P>
 - <TT>malloc()</TT> function familiy provides a new set of functions that 
  support multi-threading. '<TT>mt_</TT>' is added to the front of the original 
  functions. However, multi-thread support has not been applied to <TT>InitHeap()</TT> 
  because it wouldn't make a significant improvement.
<P>
 - The source code for the <TT>malloc()</TT> function family is separately provided
  for each function. <TT>(mt_)mallocmemdsp()</TT> is also included in the library
  release version (<TT>libnustd.a</TT>) because it won't be linked unless 
  the user uses it.
<P>
 - <TT>malloc()</TT> and <TT>free()</TT> are changed to <TT>_malloc()</TT> and <TT>_free()</TT> where those 
  functions are called within <TT>realloc()</TT>, <TT>calloc()</TT>, and <TT>memalign()</TT>.
<P>
 - <TT>malloc_st_ptr</TT> has been removed because it does not need to be an 
  external variable. This variable is defined as an auto variable 
  within <TT>realloc()</TT>, which is the only function that refers to this 
  variable.
<P>
 - Fixed a problem where the address of the next block was 
  miscalculated when trying to change the block size without changing 
  the current pointer in <TT>realloc()</TT>.
<P>
 - In <TT>modff()</TT> and <TT>powf()</TT>, some values were cast with double where float 
  should have been used. These have been fixed. Now float is used to 
  cast values where it is appropriate.
<P>
 - <TT>mt_qsort()</TT> has been provided to support multi-thread for <TT>qsort()</TT>.
<P>
 - Fixed a problem in <TT>acosf()</TT> where <TT>atan2(x, z)</TT> was used instead 
  of <TT>atan2f(x, z)</TT>.
<P>
 - The functions that are also included in N64OS have been renamed. The 
  resulting names start with '<TT>_n</TT>'.

<P>
Error correction of <TT>README.TXT</TT> (Jul 11 1998)

<P>
 - Library to be specified when creating ROM version was wrong.<BR>
(wrong)  <TT>-lultra</TT>  (right)  <TT>-lultra_rom</TT><BR>
(wrong)  <TT>-lgultra</TT>  (right)  <TT>-lgultra_rom</TT>

<P>
<B>Revisions from V1.0 (Dec 20 1997)</B>

<P>
 - Added <TT>stblib.h</TT>, in essence moving the functions defined with this 
  header.

<P>
 - Fixed the sequential search using <TT>bsearch</TT>.

<P>
 - Fixed the problems with the <TT>div</TT>, <TT>ldiv</TT>, <TT>fmod</TT>, and <TT>fmodf</TT> functions.

<P>
 - Added the <TT>isspace</TT> macro.

<P>
 - Permitted  -1 in the <TT>isx</TT> argument.

<P>
 - Changed the <TT>atof</TT>, <TT>atoi</TT>, <TT>atol</TT>, <TT>strtod</TT>, <TT>strtol</TT>, and <TT>strtoul</TT> functions 
  for <TT>isspace</TT> to use and read out header white space.

<P>
 - Fixed problem with <TT>qsort</TT> function.

<P>
 - Made some improvements to <TT>rand</TT> function.
