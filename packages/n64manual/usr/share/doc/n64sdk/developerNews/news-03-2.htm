<H3>(2)Control Stick RESET Function</H3>
<H5><U>Control Stick Program Caution</U></H5>
<P>
The Control Stick has a RESET function (refer to "Control Stick Function") that operates when the L and R Buttons and the START Button are pressed simultaneously. Because this is a hardware function, note the following programming cautions.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>When the L, R, and START Buttons are pressed simultaneously, the Control Stick's neutral position changes. 
  <LI>With these buttons pressed simultaneously, the application software can be verified by checking for the JSRST flag. 
</OL>
<P>
The application software detects those buttons that are frequently pressed simultaneously and activates special modes. Since the simultaneous pressing of the L, R, and START Buttons activates the RESET function, it is preferable not to use this combination in games which use the Control Stick. 
</P>
<P>

The simultaneous pressing of the L, R, and START buttons cannot normally be detected. Whenever it is detected, check for the JSRST flag.

<H5><U>Control Stick Function</U></H5>
<P>
The Control Stick enables precision operation by reading the stick's physical angles and directions. This affords more precise character movement than a conventional controller button. 
</P>
<P>
Please include instructions concerning the proper use of the Control Stick in each Game Pak Instruction Booklet.
</P>
<P>
The following items are explained in the Control Deck Instruction Booklet.
