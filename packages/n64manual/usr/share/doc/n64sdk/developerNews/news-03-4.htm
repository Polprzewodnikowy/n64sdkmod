<H3>(4)Multi-National Compatibility of Controller Pak Data</H3>
<P>
Currently the Controller Pak is specifically designed for domestic use only.  However, exchanging data between several different countries should be possible in the future.  For instance, you could have a battle in the U.S. against a character, who was created in Japan, by sending its data electronically.  Games like this would be possible.  Of course, various problems may arise, but as for Controller Paks, data compatibility will become increasingly important.  If you are using the same game, you should be able to Read/Write without worrying about if it is the U.S., Japanese, or European version.


</P>
<P>
To maintain Controller Pak data compatibility between several countries, consider the following points. </P>
<OL>
  <LI>Create a uniform Controller Pak Game Code for all countries.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Only English and the symbols (0Fh-41h) can be used for note names. Do not use Katakana.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Use the English version of libnos.a for the Controller Pak Menu Utility when creating games for release outside the Japanese market. Use libnos_jpn.a for Japanese versions, but observe note 2., above.<BR>
<BR>
</OL>
<P>
By following these basic guidelines, you should be able to expand the possibilities of enjoyment with games.</P>
<P>
Even if data with game files including note names having katakana in them are used in the U.S., as long as the compatibility of the data is preserved, the katakana will be converted to "-"(3bh) and displayed so no corrupted lettering will appear.</P>
<P>
Data compatibility should be maintained with a particular game, and is not guaranteed between different kinds of games.
