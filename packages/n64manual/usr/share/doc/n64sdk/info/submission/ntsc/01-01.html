<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
This document describes the procedures and requirements for submitting N64 software to Nintendo of America Inc.(NOA), for approval testing. This document also includes the submission requirements for games intended for use with the Gateway 64 System.
<P>
All software licensed by Nintendo must be submitted for approval testing by Nintendo. This approval testing process normally requires approximately 2 1/2 weeks for its completion. Individual testing will vary depending upon the software submitted and peripheral compatibility. However, the overall process includes a thorough testing of the software on all game platforms for which it is intended to be used. Game play is performed by various testing personnel in order to test all areas of game play.
<P>
All software submissions to Nintendo of America Inc. must be forwarded to the attention of NOA Product Approval Manager, Engineering. Otherwise, the submission's placement into the testing queue may be delayed. To help reduce a submission's turn-around time, licensees must assign a primary contact person for software submissions. This person is responsible for dispersing information within your company. All communications with NOA concerning a submission's testing status should be forwarded through this individual.
<P>
When a submission is approved, your company's primary contact will be notified immediately in writing.
<P>
When a submission is not approved, NOA may send a videotaped copy of the programming problem(s) which prevents the submission from being approved. This is intended to assist the licensee in analyzing the cause of the software problem. It is the licensee's responsibility to send a copy of this tape to any developers of the software. NOA strongly encourages that copies be sent to the software developers as quickly as possible.
