		<p><a name="02.9"></a><b>A Note on Objectional Material</b><br>
		A copy of the Nintendo &quot;Game Content Guidelines&quot; is included below. If you are unsure of whether an item of text or element of a game is within Nintendo Software Standards, you may contact our Product Approval Department early in the development process and they will go over questionable items over the phone. In cases concerning an extensive amount of text, please send it to the attention of NOA Product Approval Manager with the questionable items highlighted. The material will be evaluated and you will be contacted within a week to ten days.</p>
		<p><a name="02.10"></a><b>Game Content Guidelines</b><br>
		The following Game Content Guidelines are presented for assistance in the development of authorized Game Pass (i.e., both Nintendo and licensee game paks) by defining the types of themes inconsistent with Nintendo's corporate philosophy. Exceptions may be made when an objectional item is necessary to maintain the integrity of the product or the games' theme. Nintendo will only approve products (i.e., audio-visual work, packaging and instruction manuals) which do not:</p>
		<ul type="a">
			<li>contain sexually explicit content including but not limited to nudity, rape, sexual intercourse and sexual touching; for instance, Nintendo does not allow bare-breasted women in its games, however, mild displays of affection such as kissing or hugging are acceptable.
			<li>contain language or depictions which specifically denigrate members of any race, gender, ethnicity, religion or political group.
			<li>depict gratuitous or excessive blood or violence. Nintendo does not permit depictions of animal cruelty or torture.
			<li>depict verbal or physical spousal or child abuse.
			<li>permit racial, gender, ethnic, religious or political stereotypes; for example religious symbols such as crosses will be acceptable when fitting into the theme of the game and not promoting a specific religious denomination.
			<li>use profanity, obscenity or incorporate language or gestures that are offensive by prevailing public standard and tastes.
			<li>promote the use of illegal drugs, smoking materials, tobacco and/or alcohol; for example Nintendo does not allow an unnecessary beer or cigarette advertisement anywhere in a product, however Sherlock Holmes smoking a pipe would be acceptable as it fits the theme of the game.
		</ul>
		<p><a name="02.11"></a><b>Software Submission Results</b><br>
		Upon successful completion of approval testing, a formal letter of approval will be sent to the licensee by NCL's International Business Department. When a submission is not approved, NOA may send a videotaped copy of the programming problem(s) which prevent(s) the submission from being approved. This is intended to assist the licensee in analyzing the cause of the software problem. It is the licensee's responsibility to send a copy of this tape to any developer(s) of the software. NOA strongly encourages that copies be sent to developer(s) of the software as quickly as possible, to analyze and correct any screen problems.</p>
