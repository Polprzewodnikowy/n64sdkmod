<p><i>Reads data from a target system memory space</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>readmem id vaddr len</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>readmem sends a request to read data from the memory space of the target system by way of the <a href="dbgif.htm">dbgif</a> tool. The id is the thread number. Even though all threads share the same address space, you must still specify a thread. This command is shared with other debuggers in which threads may have different address spaces. The virtual address vaddr is the starting location to read. The <b>len</b> argument is the number of bytes to be read, starting from the specified location.</p>

<p>The contents of memory are displayed (in hexadecimal) on stdout as a sequence of byte values.</p>

<p>For example, this command &quot;readmem 3 0x80001000 20&quot; produces this output:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>id 3 vaddr 0x80001000 len 20
0x80001000 44 84 b0 00 00 00 00 00 20 84 00 01 44 84 b8 00
0x80001010 00 00 00 00</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Before executing this command, you must ensure that the dbgif program is running and that the <tt>METHOD</tt> environment variable is set to indicate whether this is a request for the R4300 CPU or the RCP co-processor. The value zero represents the CPU and the number one represents the RCP. In csh, this is accomplished by specifying: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>setenv METHOD 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If <tt>METHOD</tt> is set to 1 and the co-processor is running, the request will probably fail (as it should). It is generally unwise to use METHOD 1 for this command anyway; all addresses may be accessed from the CPU. </p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the event of a communications failure, the program will dump core. If that happens, you must remove the core file manually. </p>
