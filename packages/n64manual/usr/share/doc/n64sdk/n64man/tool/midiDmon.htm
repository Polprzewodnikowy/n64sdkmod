<p><i>Functions as a Midi Receiving Daemon for Nintendo 64 audio</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>midiDmon [-v] -b &lt;BankFile&gt;</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool is not supported in Ver2.0f or later.
</p>

<p>Midi Daemon is used to play midi on the Nintendo 64 in real time. The Midi Daemon requires that you specify the name of a bank file to load. You specify this name without any extensions. The bank should already have been built by using the <a href="ic.htm">ic</a> tool, and the files must have .ctl, .tbl, and .sym extensions.
</p>

<p>Use the -b argument to specify the bank file.</p>

<p>Midi Daemon also has a -v flag for verbose operation.
</p>

<p>The following is an example of a typical command line to start the Midi Daemon: 
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
    <pre>midiDmon -b ../banks/GenMidiBank </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When the Midi Daemon is ready to begin receiving midi, it will play a single note, of middle C, on the first instrument in the bank that was loaded. This is your cue that all is well. 
</p>
