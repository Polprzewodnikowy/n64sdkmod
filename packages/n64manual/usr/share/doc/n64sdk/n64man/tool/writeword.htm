<p><i>Writes data to a target system location</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>
<p>writeword id vaddr data</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>writeword sends a request to write a word into the memory space of the target system by using the <a href="dbgif.htm">dbgif</a> tool. The id is the thread number. Even though all threads share the same address space, you must still specify a thread. This command is shared with other debuggers in which threads may have different address spaces. The virtual address vaddr is the location to write, and it must be on a word boundary. The 32-bit data is the value to be written. </p>

<p>Before executing this command, you must ensure that the dbgif program is running and that the <tt>METHOD</tt> environment variable is set to indicate if this is a request for the R4300 CPU or the co-processor (RCP). The value zero represents the CPU and the number one represents the RCP. In csh, this is accomplished by specifying:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>setenv METHOD 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If <tt>METHOD</tt> is set to 1 and the co-processor is running, the request will probably fail (as it should). It is generally unwise to use METHOD 1 for this command anyway; all addresses may be accessed from the CPU. </p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the event of a communications failure, the program dumps core. If this happens, you must manually remove the core file.</p>
