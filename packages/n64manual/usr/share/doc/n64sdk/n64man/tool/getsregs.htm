<p><i>Retrieves the scalar register contents from the RCP co-processor</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>
getsregs thread </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>getsregs sends a message requesting the contents of the co-processor scalar registers from the target system by way of the <a href="dbgif.htm">dbgif</a> tool and then displays the register contents (in hex) on stdout. The contents of certain CP0 registers (such as the program counter) are also displayed. The thread argument is required, but meaningless. Choose your favorite integer.
</p>

<p>Before executing this command, you must ensure that the dbgif program is running and that the METHOD environment variable is set. Because the target system ignores the specified value, it does not need to be changed to the "correct" value of one, indicating that this is a request for the co-processor. The environment variable does need to be set so that a value can be supplied as part of the request packet.
</p>

<p>In csh, this is accomplished by specifying: 
</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>setenv METHOD 1 </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If the coprocessor is running, the request will probably fail (as it should). 
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the event of a communications failure, the program will dump core. If this happens, you must remove the core file manually.
</p>

<p>The thread argument should not be required.</p>

<p>The heading says "General Registers"; it should say "Scalar Registers." </p>
