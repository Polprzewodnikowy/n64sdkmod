<p>mksprite, mksprite32, mkisprite</p>

<p><i>Converts .rgb files to the C Sprite data structure</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>mksprite spname img.rgb tx ty overlap &gt; ../sp_spname.h<br>
mksprite32 spname img.rgb tx ty overlap &gt; ../sp_spname.h<br>
mkisprite spname img.rgb tx ty overlap &gt; ../sp_spname.h</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <a href="mksprite.htm">mksprite</a> family of programs converts large images into smaller pieces (tiles) that can be loaded individually into TMEM and drawn next to each other using the sprite library of functions (see <a href="../sp/spIntro.htm">sp</a>). Currently there are two fully functional texel types supported.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>: 32-bit RGBA (use mksprite32)</p>
    <p>: 16-bit RGBA (5:5:5:1) (use mksprite)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also supported for small image sizes (single tiles), is 8-bit Color Index (CI) mode (use <a href="mkisprite.htm">mkisprite</a>). Support for other texel types has been added, and customization is relatively easy for these commands with csh scripts.</p>

<p>The current application framework assumes that sprite textures are stored in a subdirectory called &quot;Texture&quot;. These commands are assumed to be run in this subdirectory, in which case, their output file &quot;../sp_basename.h&quot; will be in the application directory.</p>

<p>Command Line Options</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>spname</strong></dt>
    <dd>All created files and declared structures and arrays are prefixed with this basename. This keeps the names of sprite components distinct.<br>
        <br>
        </dd>
    <dt><strong>img.rgb</strong></dt>
    <dd>Is the SGI format image file. This is the basic texture that is drawn when the generated sprite is drawn. If this is a 4-channel (RGBA) image, then the indicated alpha will be used, otherwise it is assumed that alpha=1.0 for the while image. <br>
        <br>
        </dd>
    <dt><strong>tx</strong></dt>
    <dd>Is the width of the basic tile. This does not include the overlap, if any, with the horizontally adjacent tile. Also, the rightmost column of tiles may have a smaller width.<br>
        <br>
        </dd>
    <dt><strong>ty</strong></dt>
    <dd>Is the height of the basic tile. This does not include the overlap, if any, with the vertically adjacent tile. Also, the bottommost row of tiles may have a smaller height. <br>
        <br>
        </dd>
    <dt><strong>overlap</strong></dt>
    <dd>This parameter indicates how many extra texels will be added to the right and bottom of each tile. Sprites that will be used in SP_FASTCOPY mode should use overlap of 0 (no overlap). Sprites that will be scaled or shifted by fractional amounts should have an overlap of 1 to ensure seamless transitions from one tile to the next. <br>
        <br>
        </dd>
    <dt><strong>../sp_spname.h</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the recommended filename for the generated Sprite structure. <br>
        <br>
        </dd>
</dl>
