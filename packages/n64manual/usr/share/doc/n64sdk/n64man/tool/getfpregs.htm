<p><i>Retrieves floating point register contents for a target system thread</i></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>
getfpregs thread</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>getfpregs sends a message requesting the contents of the floating point registers for the specified target system thread through the <a href="dbgif.htm">dbgif</a> tool and displays the register contents (in hex) on stdout (ordinary shell window).</p>

<p>Before executing this command, you must ensure that the dbgif program is running and that the <tt>METHOD</tt> environment variable is set to zero to indicate that this is a request for the R4300 CPU. The co-processor does not have floating point registers, so it is inappropriate to set METHOD to 1 (specifying to use the co-processor). 
</p>

<p>This is accomplished by specifying the following command on the shell:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>setenv METHOD 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If the specified thread is running, the displayed registers will be the contents of the registers at the time the thread was preempted to service the getfpregs request. 
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In the event of a communications failure, the program will dump core. If this happens, you must remove the core file manually.
</p>

<p>Only the 32-bit floating point registers (&quot;float&quot; regs) are displayed. It would be nice to display the 64-bit registers (&quot;double&quot; regs) as well, however, it is not supported at this point.
