<p>The directory structure under /usr/src/PR has been reorganized. The demonstration software is now installed in /usr/src/PR/demos.

Also, refer to /usr/src/PR/demos/README_DEMOS_64DD.jp for an explanation about each demonstration software program.</p>

<h2>New Demonstration Software:</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>ddspgame</strong></dt>
  <dd>A 64DD sample program. It calls the disk function while displaying to the screen, and uses the 64DD built-in ROM font to display the resulting error and its corresponding error message.<br>
    <br>
  </dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Changed Demonstration Software:</h2>

<p>tile_rect3d.disk and font were deleted. For programming, please refer to ddspgame.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Revisions:</h2>

<p>The size of the dedicated IPL for the development-use drive (/usr/lib/PR/ipl4rom) used to be 4 Mbytes because it included the wave data and font data. However, these have been deleted, so the IPL is smaller. To access this wave data and font data during development, use the data in the IPLROM cassette. For details, please see Chapter 5 of the 64DD Programming Manual.</p>
