<h1>2.0I SGI Release Notes for naudio (12/15/98)</h1>

<p><strong>n_audio<br>
(naudio.dev)</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<p>The n_audio library, which was released as a patch for 2.0H, is 
	contained in Version 2.0I for RCP 2.0.</p>

<p>The directory structure under /usr/src/PR was changed completely and demo software is supposed to be installed in /usr/src/PR/demos.  Refer to /usr/src/PR/README.txt for other detailed structure.  Refer to /usr/src/PR/demos/README_DEMOS_NAUDIO.txt for description of each demo software.</p>

<hr>

<h2>New functions:</h2>

<p>Refer to <a href="../../../pro-man/pro28/index.htm">Chapter 28 "n_audio Library"</a> of the N64 Programming Manual for details such as how to use the n_audio library.</p>

<hr>

<h2>New demo software:</h2>

<p>playseq.naudio
        This is a sample program playseq which was changed to be compatible with n_audio.  This is a modification of playseq_naudio, which was attached as a patch when released. A bug was contained that caused Partner-N64 to stop due to a large amount of error outputs when Partner-N64 was used.  This was fixed for n_audio.  Other than that, this is same as the previous sample program playseq_naudio.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Modified demo software:</h2>

<p>None</p>

<h2>Modifications:</h2>

<p>The following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio.h.

<ol>
  <li>1.extern declaration related with n_audio microcode was included. 
	Specifically, the following two lines were added.<br>
    <br>
    extern long long int n_aspMainTextStart[], n_aspMainTextEnd[];<br>
    extern long long int n_aspMainDataStart[], n_aspMainDataEnd[];<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A declaration of the function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.  However, 
	    it is not implemented like SGI audio library.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A declaration of the function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.  This is because the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() which corresponds to this function does not exist, and also this function itself is incomplete.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the above changes, the following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio_s_to_n.h.

<ol>
  <li>A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynFreeFX() into n_audio library function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() into n_audio library function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
