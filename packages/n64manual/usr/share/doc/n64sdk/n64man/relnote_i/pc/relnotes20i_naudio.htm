<h1>2.0I PC Release Notes for naudio (12/15/98)</h1>

<p><b>n_audio</b></p>

<hr>

<p>This directory contains a patch for using the n_audio microcode & library with OS2.0i.</p>

<p>Changes were made because some bugs were found in the previous version of the n64kit patch.</p>

<p><strong>*How to Install</strong></p>

<p>First install OS 2.0i, then install this patch.</p>

<p>When you execute n_audio_pc.exe contained together with this file, you are prompted for the installation destination.  Please enter the directory under which the development environment has been installed (the default is c:\ultra).</p>

<p><strong>*How to Use</strong></p>

<p>n_audio
For details about how to use the n_audio library, please refer to Chapter 28 in the Programming Manual.</p>

<p><strong>*New Demo Software:</strong></p>

<p>playseq.naudio is the playseq sample program modified to support n_audio.</p>

<p><strong>*Changes</strong></p>

<p>Library name of N_AUDIO has been changed to libgn_audia.a from libn_audio.a. </p>

<p>The following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio.h.</p>

<ol>
<li>extern declaration related with n_audio micro code was included. Specifically, following two lines were added.

<blockquote>
<pre>extern long long int n_aspMainTextStart[], n_aspMainTextEnd[];
extern long long int n_aspMainDataStart[], n_aspMainDataEnd[];</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>A declaration of the function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.  However, it is not implemented like SGI audio library.

<li>A declaration of the function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.  This is because the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() which corresponds to this function does not exist, and also this function itself is incomplete.
</ol>

<p>Due to the above changes, the following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio_s_to_n.h.</p>

<ol>
<li>A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynFreeFX() into n_audio library function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.

<li>A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() into n_audio library function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.
</ol>
