<h3>Syntax</h3>
</P>
<P>
#include &lt;ultra64.h&gt;     /* <A HREF="../../header/ultra64.htm">ultra64.h</A> */<br>
s32 osVoiceMaskDictionary(OSVoiceHandle *hd, u8 *maskpattern, int size);<BR>
</P>
<P>
<h3>Description</h3>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>osVoiceMaskDictionary</tt> function is for masking words registered in the voice recognition system.  It can selecting words from those registered in the dictionary which are to be recognized and which are not to be recognized.<BR>
</P>
<P>
hd is the Voice Recognition System control structure.  The Voice Recognition System must be initialized with the <A href="osVoiceInit.htm">osVoiceInit</A> function before the <tt>osVoiceMaskDictionary</tt> function is called.
Specify the word mask pattern in maskpattern.  The mask data for all words are enumerated in maskpattern.  The number of bytes in maskpattern is specified in size.
</P>
<P>
In the mask data, one byte equals one word.  A zero (0) indicates to mask (do not recognize a word) and a one (1) indicates not to mask (recognize a word).The word number (the number assigned the registered words in the order that they were registered) sequence in the mask data corresponds with the LSB to MSB sequence.  In other words,  bit 0 of the first byte corresponds with word No. 0, while bit 7 corresponds with word No. 7. If the number of words is not a multiple of 8, put zeros (0) in the remaining most significant bits of the last byte of the mask data.<BR>
</P>
<P>
If the <tt>osVoiceMaskDictionary</tt> function has not been called, all of the words are unmasked. <BR>
</P>
<P>
The returned value is an error code.  A 0 (zero) is returned when processing ends normally.  If an error occurs, this function has the following error codes.

</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>CONT_ERR_VOICE_NO_RESPONSE</B>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>
There was no response from the Voice Recognition System.  There may be a problem with the hardware.
</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>CONT_ERR_CONTRFAIL</B>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>
There was a data transmission failure.  There is a problem in the Voice Recognition System connection.
