<p><i>Registers words to the Voice Recognition System dictionary</p></i>
</P>
<P>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
</P>
<P>
#include &lt;ultra64.h&gt;     /* <A HREF="../../header/ultra64.htm">ultra64.h</A> */
</P>
<P>
s32 osVoiceSetWord(OSVoiceHandle *hd, u8 *word);
</P>
<P>
<h3>Description</h3>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>osVoiceSetWord</tt> function is for registering words in the Voice Recognition System dictionary.<BR>
</P>
<P>
hd is the Voice Recognition System control structure.  The Voice Recognition System must be initialized with the <A href="osVoiceInit.htm">osVoiceInit</A> function before the <tt>osVoiceSetWord</tt> function is called.
The word (SJIS) to be registered is specified in "word."  The word can be up to 17 characters long. Since calling the <tt>osVoiceSetWord</tt> function once registers one word, execute <tt>osVoiceSetWord</tt> multiple times to register multiple words.  The number of words registered must match the number set by the <a href="osVoiceClearDictionary.htm">osVoiceClearDictionary</a> function.  Please note that an error will be generated when the <a href="osVoiceStartReadData.htm">osVoiceStartReadData</a> function is executed, if the number of words registered is greater than or less than the specified number of words. <BR>
</P>
<P>
The maximum number of words which can be registered in the dictionary is about 80 words, assuming 5 syllables per word.  Therefore, while the maximum number of words which can be registered is set at 255, if there are several syllables per word, the dictionary may subsequently overflow the memory.  In this case, voice recognition can be executed without an error being caused by the <tt>osVoiceStartReadData</tt> function even if the number of registered words is less than the number set by the <tt>osVoiceClearDictionary</tt> function. <BR>
</P>
<P>
The characters which can be registered and their codes are shown in the table below.<BR>
</P>
<CENTER>
<table border=0 align="center">
<tr><td>

</CENTER>
<P>
In addition, the following restrictions apply to character combinations when registering words.  Use the <A href="osVoiceCheckWord.htm">osVoiceCheckWord</A> function to check whether or not the word that you are trying to register can be registered in the Voice Recognition System.  Use this in the case of game applications in which registered words will be input during debugging or by the game player.
