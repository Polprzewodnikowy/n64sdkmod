Syntax</h3>

<font face="courier">
#include &lt;ultra64.h&gt;<br> 
s32&nbsp; osFlashAllErase(void); 
</font> 
 
<h3> 
Description</h3> 
This is a function that deletes the entire data of 1M Flash. 
<p>For a return value, 0 is returned when sucessful and -1 when failed. 
As the entire area is deleted at one time, this function allows you to 
delete the entire area in high speed, rather than repeating the execution 
of <font face="courier">osFlashSectorErase</font>. 
<p>Timer wait is done inside of <font face="courier">osFlashAllErase</font>. Since timer management 
is done by VI manager, it is necessary to boot VI manager with <font face="courier">osCreateViManager</font> 
prior to the use of this function. It takes from several msec to 
several hundred msec to delete the entire area of data.
