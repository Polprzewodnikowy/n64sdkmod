Description</h3>
This is a function that deletes the data of certain sectors of 1M Flash.
<p>It specifies page number as an argument and deletes the sector which
contains the specified page number.
<p>The size of 1 sector is 128 pages (16K bytes), and each page of 0~0x7f,
0x80~0xff, 0x100~0x17f... is considered to be 1 sector.
<p>For return values, 0 is returned when delete is successful and -1 when
failed.
<p>Timer wait is operated in <font face="courier">osFlashSectorErase</font>. Since timer management
is done by VI manager, it is necessary to boot VI manager with <font face="courier">osCreateViManager</font>
before using this function. It takes from several msec to several
hundred msec to delete data of 1 sector.
