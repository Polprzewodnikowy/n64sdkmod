The <tt>osVoiceStartReadData</tt> function is for starting recognition processing by the Voice Recognition System.  Before starting voice recognition processing with the <tt>osVoiceStartReadData</tt> function, the Voice Recognition System must be initialized with the <A href="osVoiceInit.htm">osVoiceInit</A> function, the dictionary must be initialized with the <A href="osVoiceClearDictionary.htm">osVoiceClearDictionary</A> function, and word registration must be performed with the <A href="osVoiceSetWord.htm">osVoiceSetWord</A> function.  Be absolutely sure to call the <tt>osVoiceStartReadData</tt> function after calling these functions. 
</P>
<P>
After calling the <tt>osVoiceStartReadData</tt> function, recognition results can be obtained by calling the <A href="osVoiceGetReadData.htm">osVoiceGetReadData</A> function.  In addition, once voice recognition has been started, call the <A href="osVoiceStopReadData.htm">osVoiceStopReadData</A> function to forcibly stop recognition.
