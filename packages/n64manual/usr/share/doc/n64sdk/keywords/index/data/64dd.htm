<h1>Keywords - N64 Disk Drive</h1>

<hr>

<p><a name="block"><strong>block</strong><br>
</a>One-half of one of the several concentric recording areas on the disk surface.  N64 Disk Drive accesses the disk with a block as the minimum unit.</p>

<p><a name="EPI functions"><strong>EPI functions</strong><br>
</a>The abbreviation for Enhanced PI. Functions that can be used to specify
the devices to access new devices such as N64 Disk Drive as well as conventional
cartriages.</p>

<p><a name="head0, head1"><strong>head0, head1</strong><br>
</a>N64 Disk Drive accesses both surfaces of the disk, with the front surface being head 0 and the rear surface being head 1. </p>

<p><strong><a name="IPL">IPL</a><br>
</strong>Boot program for N64 Disk Drive disk in the mask ROM inside N64 Disk Drive.</p>

<p><a name="LBA"><strong>LBA</strong><br>
</a>Acronyms of Logical Block Address. Serial numbers used for N64 Disk Drive to
access the blocks on disk.</p>

<p><a name="leo manager"><strong>leo manager</strong><br>
</a>Device drivers for N64 Disk Drive that need to be launched before executing any
N64 Disk Drive functions. Consists of two leo manager threads: command thread and
interupt thead.</p>

<p><a name="packet"><strong>packet</strong><br>
</a>The unit of data used for transmission. Data divided into specific
length with destination information added.</p>

<p><a name="rezero"><strong>rezero</strong><br>

</p>

<p><a name="RTC"><strong>RTC</strong><br>
</a>Acronyms of Real Time Clock. A built-in real time clock for N64 Disk Drive with
back-up batteries.</p>

<p><a name="track"><strong>track</strong><br>
</a>One of several concentric recording areas on the disk surface. </p>

<p><a name="zone"><strong>zone</strong><br>
</a>In order to accommodate increased density, N64 Disk Drive has a format which makes it as large as the external memory capacity.  Thus, the system is formatted divided into groups called zones whose  outer-most perimeter is 19,720 bytes, whose inner-most perimeter is 9,520 bytes, and whose size does not change continuously, so that the same block size is in the same zone.  It is divided into 8 zones. </p>
